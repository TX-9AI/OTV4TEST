analysis/liquidity_mapper.py  v4.4
v4.4  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r29 — WORDING ONLY: LIQ.6 point 2 says what the closed-session
      rule is FOR. The operator read the old text and called it nebulous; it named
      the rule and not the harm it prevents. No code changed.
v4.3  2026-09-03  r231 — EQUAL HIGHS/LOWS ARE GONE; NEAREST REPLACES LAST.
      Operator, 2026-09-03: *"I don't want equal highs/lows identified at all.
      Those are not reliable enough."* The map is NAMED LEVELS and FORK TINES,
      nothing else. `_find_pools` is DELETED rather than left uncalled (r190 —
      an orphaned producer is what the next reader re-wires).
      ⚠️ VERIFIED BEFORE REMOVAL (§23): every external reader of `lmap.pools`
      already filtered them out — `orb_strategy:499`, `main.py:1267`,
      `shadow/primitives.py:167`. One external reader in the tree, and it
      already ignored them.
      🔑 AND THEY COULD COST A TRADE: an unnamed sweep can WIN the
      freshest-sweep selection in `sweep_credit_spread` (that loop does not
      filter on name) and then FAIL the `named` condition on the next line —
      taking the slot and declining while a valid named sweep sat unselected.
      🔴 `_flag_nearby_pools` WAS LAST-MATCH-WINS, NOT NEAREST. Every pool
      inside the buffer overwrote the field, so it held whichever came LAST in
      list order — and the list is ordered by producer, not by distance.
      Measured at HEAD on a farthest-first fixture: 115.00 and 85.00 where the
      nearest levels were 112.00 and 88.00.
      ⚠️ v3.1's named-precedence filter is REMOVED, not orphaned: with
      `_find_pools` gone every producer names its pool, so `named` was always
      the whole list and the `else` branch was unreachable.
      ⚠️ NOT TOUCHED, filed SWEEP.6: line ~1057 compares a 1m tine touch's
      `bars_ago` against a possibly-15m sweep's, and the two `min(bars_ago)`
      selections compare across timeframes. Units, not identity — unruled.
v4.2  2026-08-27  r163 — THE FORK'S TINES ARE MOVING LIQUIDITY LEVELS, AND A
      TOUCH IS THEIR EVENT. Operator, 2026-08-27: *"it's basically a moving
      level that sweep is allowed to use, but with a touch, not a reject. The
      plan would still need to select a strike beyond the move that caused
      the touch."* And: *"a moving target liquidity mapper but with the
      elements of slope and time."*
      · `LiquidityPool` gains `moving`, `slope_per_min`, `as_of` — a tine is a
        named pool whose price is a function of TIME: `price_at(ts)` =
        price − slope·(minutes to now). PDH/PDL have slope 0 and are unchanged.
      · `LiquiditySweep` gains `touch` (the event was a TOUCH, not a reclaim)
        and `moving`, so consumers can key a spent lock by NAME rather than by
        a price that drifts every bar.
      · `publish_tines(lmap, ctm, df_1m)` — called at the assembly point after
        the condor trigger map is built: each active rail ("1h upper tine",
        "1d lower tine") becomes a moving named pool, and `_detect_touches`
        walks the last TOUCH_LOOKBACK_BARS 1m bars evaluating the rail WHERE
        IT WAS ON EACH BAR (slope × bars back), not where it is now. A bar
        whose high reaches the upper rail(t) (low reaches the lower) is a
        touch; the event is born READY (`reclaimed=True` — the touch IS the
        trigger); `sweep_price` is the EXTREME of the touching move so the
        plan selects the short strike beyond it; ACCEPT_CLOSES closes beyond
        rail(t) since the first touch INVALIDATE it (a tine that is broken
        is not a tine). Emitted as a `LiquiditySweep` with kind high_sweep /
        low_sweep so `boundary_from_sweep` and the sweep's plan need no
        special case. The tine's per-tick position also lands on the map as
        a pool, so the session map's geometry ruling applies to it.
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

analysis/liquidity_mapper.py — AUDIT A2: THE INPUT COULD NOT
SWP.11: COUNT ACCEPTANCE AFTER THE RECLAIM, NOT DURING
        THE REJECTION. `window` starts at the SWEEP BAR, and on a high sweep
        price is BY DEFINITION above the pool there - so the sweep's OWN close
        counted as "acceptance", and so did every bar of the rejection still
        working back. THE VETO WINDOW AND THE CONFIRMATION WINDOW WERE THE SAME
        WINDOW.
        MEASURED 2026-08-15: `closes_beyond >= 2` blocked 64.5% of named-pool
        ticks; of 25,792 vetoed ticks post-08-11, 100% WERE RECLAIMED AND 0%
        WERE GENUINE ACCEPTANCE. SWP.9 measured it at 67% of the 95.9% vetoed.
        WICKS AND BODIES: a wick is a touch, a close is a decision. Acceptance
        only means something ONCE PRICE HAS RETURNED - a close beyond AFTER the
        reclaim means price left again and stayed. Before that it is the move.
        NOT A BLANKET UNGATE: post-reclaim closes beyond the level still veto,
        and a test asserts it.
        ALSO FIXED HERE: the first draft used `_rc_bar` in `closes_beyond`
        while defining it FOURTEEN LINES LATER - a NameError on every sweep
        evaluation, the same class as the `ctx` P0 that stopped boxes trading
        on 08-18. An import check cannot catch it; the tests now EXECUTE the
        path (WA 21).
SWP.10: AGE THE SWEEP FROM THE RECLAIM, NOT THE SWEEP BAR.
        `bars_ago` counted from the sweep bar, but the setup IS NOT TRADEABLE
        until price closes back inside. The mapper runs on 5m/15m with
        SWEEP_REJECTION_CANDLES=3, so confirmation lands 5-20 MINUTES later and
        `age_decay = 0.5**(age/3)` charged the signal for a delay it could not
        act inside.
        MEASURED (SWP.9, 269,027 named rows / 27 sessions): 95.9% hard-vetoed
        to 0.000 (67% of those by veto_accept); of the 4.1% surviving,
        age_decay median 0.062 = ~12 bars = ~60 MINUTES, while trend_opp median
        was 1.000 - age was the SOLE binding damper. Median surviving score
        ~0.031 against SWEEP_SETUP_FLOOR 0.05: THE SURVIVORS DID NOT CLEAR
        THEIR OWN DISPATCH FLOOR.
        NOT A RECALIBRATION. No constant changed - not SWEEP_HALFLIFE_BARS, not
        the floor. At the observed median the score moves 0.031 -> 0.062, past
        the floor on the arithmetic alone.
        Both sweep directions fixed; `bar_index` still records the sweep bar as
        the diagnostic anchor, `reclaim_bar_index` is new.
        CARRY LIQ.6, AND FOUR SMALLER DEFECTS.
audit #2 fixes:
        (A2.1) SECTION_LOOKBACK_DAYS=10 read df_5m, which the cache caps at
        100 bars (~8.3h of 24h tape). Truncated sections were admitted as
        closed pools at WRONG prices (reproduced: true Asia High 101.10
        emitted as 97.10), and rung prices MUTATED intraday as the window
        slid — the self-rewriting level, back through the input. Fixes:
        `analyze()` takes `named_df` (a deep store frame main now supplies;
        1h bars, hour granularity is all the section masks use), and a
        section is admitted ONLY if the frame reaches its start instant —
        a left-truncated section is skipped, on ANY input depth.
        (A2.5) the NY section was fixed at 13-20 UTC while RTH is defined
        in ET: from 2026-11-01 (EST) the mask would have admitted TODAY'S
        FORMING RTH extreme as a pool from 3:00pm ET. NY hours now derive
        from the date's ET offset via ZoneInfo (13-20 EDT / 14-21 EST) —
        never a hardcoded offset. Still-forming is now an INSTANT test
        (tape must reach the section's end), not an hour comparison.
        (A2.6) NAMED_POOLS_INCLUDE_SESSIONS removed: the LIQ.6 ladder never
        consulted it, so the knob was dead and its test asserted the
        opposite of production. Session rungs are ON by doctrine; the
        invariant the tests now pin is "no still-forming section is a pool".
        (A2.7) `_add_named_pool` more-extreme-wins REPLACED the name
        wholesale, so PDH could vanish from the map when a rung within the
        0.2% zone out-priced it (reproduced). The merge is now symmetric:
        a collision never deletes a fact in either direction.
        (A2.8) the candle-count fallback still built OLD-definition session
        pools, and any exception in the LIQ.6 path silently reverted a tick
        emits PDH/PDL only, and the exception path warns ONCE per process.
        Hygiene: dead ASIA/LONDON/NY_START/END constants (values
        contradicted SECTIONS) and the never-read RTH_OPEN_UTC deleted.
LIQ.1 + LIQ.3.
        Two changes, both found by running the REAL code over real tape and a
        fabricated tape rather than by reading it.
        LIQ.1(a) LONDON/ASIA ARE NO LONGER SWEEPABLE POOLS. Operator: "the
        London session in particular was creating a moving target and that has
        to go." The window is 07:00-16:00 UTC against RTH 13:30-20:00 — A 2.5
        HOUR OVERLAP — so from 09:30 to 12:00 ET "London High" is set by the
        price being traded right now. Sweeping it sweeps a level RTH made
        seconds ago. ⚠️ THIS RETROACTIVELY UNDERMINES THE SHADOW OBSERVER'S
        61.3% LONDON SHARE: London was NEAREST because it TRACKS PRICE, so
        SWP.3's London bonus was fitted to an artefact. The lmap FIELDS stay
        populated (shadow/primitives.py reads them); only the POOL goes.
        OT_LIQ_SESSION_POOLS=1 restores.
        LIQ.1(b) THE DEDUPE DELETED THE NAMED SWEEP. A PDH/PDL almost always
        ALSO sits on an equal-high/low cluster — that coincidence is WHY it is
        liquidity — so one raid makes TWO sweeps with identical kind, pool_price
        and bars_ago. They collide on the dedupe key; `mins < cmins` is FALSE on
        equality, so the FIRST-inserted survived and unnamed pools are found
        first. `swept_named_level` came back EMPTY, L1's `veto_loc` hard-vetoed,
        and THE SWEEP SCORE WAS EXACTLY 0.000 on a perfect raid. Measured on a
        fabricated PDL raid: 0.000 before, 1.000 after. It also made v3.1's
        "named takes precedence" filter DEAD CODE — that filter reads the
        ALREADY-DEDUPED list.
        ⚠️ LIVE INCIDENCE UNKNOWN: the 08-11 corpus shows veto_loc PASSING on
        99.6% of ticks, so this is real but may be rare.
        LIQ.3 RUNNING INVALIDATION — `sweep_invalidated`, recomputed EVERY TICK.
        Operator: "if the market makers are driving the price to either extreme
        what difference does it make if it takes an hour or if it takes all
        day?" None — what ends the thesis is the LEVEL FAILING. `closes_beyond`
        already asks exactly that question but is a BIRTH-TIME snapshot, counted
        over the 2-3 bars after the raid and NEVER UPDATED, so nothing ever
        re-checked whether the level still held. MEASURED over 90 real
        symbol-days: of the stale sweeps the 8-bar gate refused, **32.9% still
        had a LIVE thesis** (854 of 2,593) — ~9.5 valid setups discarded per
        symbol-day on a clock rather than on invalidation.
        ⚠️ REJECTED ALTERNATIVE, recorded so it is not re-proposed: scoping
        named-precedence to FRESH sweeps (LIQ.2, built and measured 2026-08-11)
        moved refusals 98.6% -> 98.4% and evicts exactly the stale-but-live
        setups this change exists to keep. Dropped.
AS-OF named levels.
        _find_named_levels derived 'today' from the wall clock, so (a) every
        tape replay saw ZERO named pools (measured: 0 of 1,367 evals across
        3 symbols × 26 sessions — the sweep chain's first link, severed), and
        (b) live Mondays had no PDH/PDL (calendar-minus-one = Sunday). Dates
        now derive from the frame's last bar; 'yesterday' is the previous
        TRADING day present in the frame. Session windows unchanged.
--- original header follows --- — Institutional liquidity mapping.
Tracks equal highs/lows, stop clusters, liquidity sweeps, and
imbalance fills. Core input for the sweep reversal strategy.
SWEEP DEFINITION CORRECTION (rejection, not just penetration).
        The old rejection_pct measured distance from the wick to the LAST close in
        the window — it never checked whether price came back INSIDE the swept
        level. A breakout candle that poked a pool and CLOSED THROUGH it (accepted)
        scored a high rejection_pct and was stamped a confirmed sweep. That is the
        defect that let breakouts (AVGO 380+ open-air ladder) be classified as
        sweeps. A sweep BY DEFINITION requires penetration AND rejection — price
        thrown back and holding inside the level. Now each LiquiditySweep also
        records `reclaimed` (did closes return inside the pool and hold) and
        `closes_beyond` (how many closes ACCEPTED through it). rejection_pct is now
        measured off a close that is actually back inside the level. Acceptance
        (closes_beyond >= ACCEPT_CLOSES) is no longer a sweep — it is a breakout.
        Calibration constants (ACCEPT_CLOSES, hold bars) are placeholders to be
        tightened as candle-logger sessions accumulate; the reclaim REQUIREMENT
        itself is definitional, not a tunable.
detection fixes: recent_sweep is now selected by ACTUAL
        TIME (own-timeframe bars_ago × tf minutes), not raw cross-timeframe bar
        index; sweep_age_bars reported in consistent 5m-equivalent bars (fixes
        fresh sweeps look stale); duplicate same-level sweeps are collapsed.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
v1.1 additions:
- Previous Day High/Low (PDH/PDL) as named high-value liquidity pools
- Previous Session High/Low (Asia, London, NY) as named pools
- Named pools carry higher confluence weight in sweep reversal strategy
LIQ.6 (2026-08-15) — A WHOLESALE CHANGE TO WHAT A NAMED POOL IS.
    Everything before this was correct FOR ITS TIME and is incorrect under the
    clearer rules. Four changes, all from the operator:
    1. SECTIONS ARE NON-OVERLAPPING AND CONTIGUOUS in UTC — Asia 00-08,
       London 08-13, NY 13-20. A bar belongs to exactly one. The old windows
       overlapped (Asia 00-08, London 07-16, NY 13-22), which is how
       "London High" could be set by a price RTH traded seconds ago and why
       LIQ.1 had to remove London wholesale. Only the OVERLAPPING TAIL was ever
       the problem; the pre-RTH London extreme is a real level and is back.
    2. ONLY A CLOSED SESSION MAKES A LEVEL.
       WHAT A LEVEL IS FOR: a fixed price where stops already rest, that price
       can come back to and TEST. That needs the price to stop moving first.
       WHY TODAY'S RTH HIGH/LOW IS NOT ONE: it is still being made. Every new
       high moves it, so in a trending session it is "breached" on every print
       and there is nothing for price to return to. Treating it as a level did
       two kinds of damage, both measured:
         · a "sweep" of it was just price trading where it traded seconds ago;
         · anything scored against it scored a MOVING TARGET — the LIQ.5 retreat
           probe's NY 4.1-4.2 vs PDH/PDL 1.1-1.2 was that artefact, not a better
           level (and LIQ.1's London share the same thing, via overlapping hours).
       SO: a session counts once it has CLOSED — completed, not calendar date.
       Today's Asia and pre-RTH London are closed by 09:30 and count from the
       open; an untaken RTH high from five days ago still counts. Today's RTH
       high/low is not thrown away — it is `session_high`/`session_low` — it just
       is not a level until the session closes.
    3. `NY High/Low` IS SESSION-TYPE, NOT DATE-RELATIVE. PDH/PDL means literally
       yesterday. An RTH extreme from five days ago that nothing has taken is
       still "NY High" and is still where the stops are.
    4. A LADDER THREE DEEP, AND A BROKEN LEVEL IS NOT A POOL. "More extreme
       means the less extreme level was already invalidated" — if a later
       section printed a higher high, price went THROUGH the earlier one to get
       there and those stops are gone. Rung 1 is the next liquidity; rungs 2-3
       are where price runs if it takes rung 1. The rung is always in the name.
    ⚠️ CONSEQUENCE FOR ANALYSIS: every sweep in the archive was scored against
    the OLD definition. The 2026-08-15 reads (accept-veto at 64.5%, the retreat
    distribution, the SWEEP tape gap) describe a mapper that no longer exists —
    bake. **The retreat probe must be re-run, and the sweep TIMING change waits
    until this has collected**, or neither can be attributed.

    # they are still forming. Exception: overnight low/high are still today, but
    # an EARLIER session and therefore valid."
    #
    # The test is COMPLETED vs STILL FORMING, not the calendar date:
    #   · Asia (00:00-08:00 UTC) is closed before RTH opens -> VALID, today.
    #   · London BEFORE RTH open is closed -> VALID. London AFTER 13:30 is the
    #     moving target LIQ.1 removed. **LIQ.1 removed the WHOLE session when
    #     only the overlapping tail was the problem** — the pre-RTH London
    #     extreme is exactly the kind of level worth naming, so the window is
    #     now CLIPPED rather than gated off.
    #   · TODAY'S RTH high/low is NEVER a pool. It is `session_high`/
    #     `session_low`, which the not-exceeded filter already tracks.
    #
    # ⚠️ AND `NY High/Low` MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM `PDH/PDL`.
    # PDH/PDL is DATE-RELATIVE — literally yesterday. NY High/Low is
    # SESSION-TYPE: the last UNBROKEN RTH extreme, whenever it formed. Operator:
    # "If one of the last extremes was NY H/L but it was 5 days ago, then it's
    # not PDH/PDL — it accurately is NY H/L." An untouched extreme is where the
    # stops are REGARDLESS of when it formed, which is what makes it liquidity.
    # The old code named TODAY'S FORMING RTH extreme "NY High/Low" — neither
    # yesterday's nor the last unbroken one — so it was a self-rewriting level.
    # MEASURED (LIQ.5 retreat probe): NY levels showed a retreat mean of 4.1-4.2
    # against PDH/PDL's 1.1-1.2. **That gap was the artefact of a moving target,
    # not evidence of a better level.**

        Nearest is the whole meaning of the field; list order is an accident.
