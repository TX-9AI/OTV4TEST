data/open_interest.py  v4.2
v4.2  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r6 — one event loop per fetch, immediate retry on a
      closed loop: the first batch of every cycle failed "Event loop is closed"
      because each batch ran under its own asyncio.run(); OI arrived (226
      non-zero strikes by 15:43) but only half the chain per cycle.
v4.1  2026-08-21  get_market_data_by_type IS A COROUTINE and was called
      without await - GEX has run WITHOUT open interest on every cycle since
      the port, logging a warning nobody actioned. Bridged for both call
      contexts.
Real open interest, fetched once per session over REST. GEX has never had it.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Built at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires this block be read before the file is edited.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS FIXES, AND HOW LONG IT WAS BROKEN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`OptionContract.open_interest` is declared at `options_chain.py:141` and
**NEVER ASSIGNED ANYWHERE**. It defaults to 0 and stays 0. `_apply_market_data`
takes exactly two maps - greeks and quote - and the chain subscribes to Greeks
and Quote only. **No OI source was ever wired.**

`gex_data` then does this, at lines 173 and 184:

    oi_proxy = open_interest if open_interest > 0 else max(1, int(1000 * gamma))
    gex      = gamma * oi_proxy * 100 * spot

Since OI is always 0, every strike falls to the proxy, so:

    **gex ~ 100,000 * gamma^2 * spot**

⚠️ **GEX HAS NEVER MEASURED DEALER POSITIONING. IT IS A GAMMA-SQUARED SURFACE.**
Three observed consequences, all confirmed in the live SPX log 2026-08-19:
  · **The "pin" is always at the money.** Gamma peaks at ATM by definition and
    squaring sharpens the peak, so the pin reports where price ALREADY IS. The
    log shows `pin = call_wall = $7725` with spot sitting on it.
  · **It churns violently.** gamma^2 near ATM moves with every tick of spot:
    GEX ran 12.4M -> 0.1M -> 2.0M in three minutes, flipping PINNING to NEUTRAL
    and back inside 90 seconds.
  · **The archive is unrecoverable.** 21 dates of chain snapshots carry
    `"oi": 0` on every contract (542 of 542 on SPX 08-19), so the historical
    pin cannot be reconstructed and the butterfly cannot be validated
    retrospectively. **Collection starts now; the trade waits for the data.**

⚠️ AND THE PROXY'S OWN COMMENT SHOWS THE REASONING THAT FAILED: *"Higher gamma
+ tighter spread = more dealer hedging at that strike."* That is a guess, and
squaring gamma is not a proxy for open interest - it is a different quantity.
A stand-in that is never labelled as unavailable becomes indistinguishable from
data, which is the same failure as v3's numeric defaults reading as measured
zeros.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY REST AND NOT A THIRD SUBSCRIPTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`tastytrade.dxfeed.Summary` DOES carry `open_interest` - verified on the box.
But a Summary subscription is another stream PER CONTRACT, and v3.1 measured
TastyTrade's unpublished concurrent-session cap at ~40; the fleet already runs
~270 subscriptions. **That cost is the likeliest reason OI was never wired and
the proxy was invented instead.**

**OI updates ONCE A DAY.** It does not need a stream. `get_market_data_by_type`
returns `MarketData` carrying `open_interest` for a list of option symbols - one
REST call, cached for the session, zero subscription cost. The cadence of the
data and the cadence of the fetch finally agree.

⚠️ AND ZERO STAYS ZERO HERE. If the fetch fails or a symbol is absent, this
returns NOTHING for that symbol rather than a substitute. **A missing value must
remain missing** - inventing one is exactly how gamma-squared came to be
reported as gamma exposure for the life of the project.

    🔴 v4.1 (2026-08-21) — `get_market_data_by_type` IS A COROUTINE FUNCTION and
    was being called WITHOUT await. Python returned a coroutine object, the
    `for r in rows` below raised "'coroutine' object is not iterable", the
    broad except swallowed it as a warning, and every cycle on every box logged
        OI wiring failed ('coroutine' object is not iterable)
        - GEX runs WITHOUT open interest
    ⚠️ SO GEX HAS NEVER ONCE HAD OPEN INTEREST IN v4. That is the handoff's open
    item "open_interest NON-ZERO in the log - v4's copy of OI.1 has never run":
    it never ran because it could not. The gamma surface has been built from
    volume-weighted greeks alone, and the butterfly's unpark depends on it.
    ⚠️ AND IT FAILED LOUDLY-BUT-HARMLESSLY, which is why it survived: a WARNING
    every cycle, with the run continuing. An error that is logged and then
    ignored is a decision nobody made.

    The SDK offers ONLY async variants (checked: `get_market_data` and
    `get_market_data_by_type` are both `async def`), so the bridge lives here.
    Both call contexts are handled because this is reached from the sync chain
    fetch AND, on some paths, from inside a running loop: `asyncio.run` raises
    if a loop is already running, so that case is handed to a worker thread
    with its own loop rather than crashing.
