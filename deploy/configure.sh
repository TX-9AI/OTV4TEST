# deploy/configure.sh  v4.5
# v4.5  2026-09-11  OTV4TEST r14 — moved from the repo root to deploy/ (root cleanup); no behaviour change.
#
# v4.4  2026-08-31  r203 — THE r201 SPOT HINT WAS BROKEN AND BAKED. It read a
#   `data/` subdirectory that does not exist, and `2>/dev/null` made the
#   failure look like a deliberate blank. Paths now come from config.py;
#   stderr is visible; the land gate RUNS the function and requires output.
#   🔴 r201's gate checked that the function existed and that this file
#   parsed. Presence and a clean parse are not evidence that a display
#   displays.
#
# v4.3  2026-08-31  r201 — menu item 8: ORB BUDGET (OT_ORB_BUDGET_USD), set
#   PER UNDERLYING. Shows SPOT as the reference — live from orb_state.json,
#   or derived from the last trade's underlying_entry, labelled either way.
#   ⚠️ The default fails closed at one trade's risk, so an unconfigured box
#   trades SMALL; the menu labels it "(default)" so it does not read broken.
#   ⚠️ Fixed in passing: the prompt said "between 1 and 7" on an 8-item menu.
# Per-box configuration.
#
# v4.2  2026-08-20  change_relaxed now calls reload_daemon after set_env, like
#       every other change_*. set_env edits the UNIT FILE; without the reload
#       systemd restarts from its cached copy, so the bot runs the OLD value
#       while the menu reports the new one. Pinned by check_configure_relaxed
#       C6: any function that calls set_env must also call reload_daemon.
#
# v4.1  2026-08-20  Option 7 (relaxed entry) called an undefined `confirm`,
#       so it always took the else branch: it could never be switched ON, and
#       opening the item wrote OT_RELAXED_ENTRY=0. Now calls ask_yn, the
#       helper the rest of the file uses. Both branches are executed by
#       tests/check_configure_relaxed.py, which also traps
#       command-not-found so a future undefined helper cannot fail quietly.
#
# v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.
#
# INHERITED DOCTRINE
# MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
# Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
# reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
# defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
# this block be read before the file is edited.
#
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
#         mapping optimization (single shared TastyTrade candle feed). No
#         logic change in this file.
#  options_trader v2.0  —  Live Configuration Manager
#  v1.0 — original release
#  replaced SMS/Twilio with Telegram
#  swapped menu order: Telegram now 4, TT credentials now 5
#  fixed menu display lines to match handler order
#  auto restart on exit if changes made, no prompt
#  wipe trades.db on instrument change (paper mode only);
#          ORB range auto-fetched for new instrument via get_orb_range.py
#  add Daily loss cap override menu (OT_DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT)
#  add single-name instruments (directional-only) to the
#          instrument menu for wider paper-trading coverage
#  archive trades.db (+WAL sidecars) on EVERY mode switch,
#          labeled by the outgoing mode (trades_paper_*.db / trades_live_*.db).
#          Paper and live histories never share a file (audit defect Q);
#          companion to trade_logger v3.7 mode-scoped queries.
#  going LIVE now reports that broker reconciliation
#          auto-enables with the mode (config.py v1.8 default follows
#          OT_PAPER_TRADING); show_config gains a "Broker reconcile" status
#          line; warns loudly if OT_BROKER_RECONCILE=False pins it off.
#  instrument picker now types the ticker (validated against
#          config.STRIKE_INCREMENTS) instead of a numbered menu — scales to the
#          full screener universe
#  Run this anytime to view or change bot settings.
#  Changes take effect on the NEXT bot start — the bot is
#  never restarted automatically to avoid mid-session surprises.
#  Usage:
#    ./configure.sh          — interactive menu
#    ./configure.sh --show   — print current config and exit

# ── r203 — SPOT, FOR SIZING THE ORB BUDGET AGAINST ────────────────────────
# 🔴 THIS FUNCTION SHIPPED BROKEN IN r201 AND THE FLEET BAKED IT. It read
# `<install>/data/orb_state.json` and `<install>/data/trades.db`. Neither
# exists: both files sit at the install root, and both paths were already in
# config.py — DB_PATH at 1604, LOG_FILE at 1613 — with orb_state.json written
# beside the log (main.py ~1358). I invented a subdirectory instead of reading
# two lines I had edited an hour earlier.
# 🔴 AND `2>/dev/null` TURNED THE FAILURE INTO A BLANK LINE. That was a
# deliberate choice, made to keep this screen tidy, on a feature whose entire
# job is to display a number. Silence over noise is the failure class this
# project exists to hunt, committed inside a display.
# 🔴 THE TEST COULD NOT FAIL. I built a fixture directory matching my own guess
# and verified against it. It passed, and it proved only that the guess was
# consistent with itself. The r201 land gate asserted the function EXISTED and
# that configure.sh PARSED — neither asks whether it produces output.
# 🔑 THE FIX, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY:
#   · paths are IMPORTED from config, never spelled here, so a future move of
#     either file cannot silently blank this display;
#   · stderr is NOT suppressed — every failure names itself and its path;
#   · the r203 land gate RUNS this body against a planted repo and REQUIRES a
#     Spot line back, and refuses both a literal `data/` path and any
#     re-suppression of stderr on this call.
