# v1.1  2026-09-25  OTV4TEST r138 — THE BOT UNIT'S INSTRUMENT WINS, AND A MISMATCH
#       REFUSES. v1.0 preferred $OT_INSTRUMENT over the unit. On the first SOFI
#       box the operator ran this from the bootstrap's [deploy] tmux shell, which
#       still exported OT_INSTRUMENT=QQQ after configure item 1 had moved the
#       unit to SOFI, and it printed "managed: pushing as sym=QQQ" - a SOFI box
#       about to push into the mainline QQQ partition. Measured: nothing reached
#       S3 (0 objects from that host, any symbol). Now the unit is the source of
#       truth; the environment is used ONLY when no unit exists yet, and when both
#       are set and DISAGREE nothing is changed and the conflict is named.
#
# v1.0  2026-09-24  OTV4TEST r136 — ONE SWITCH: "managed" OR "standalone" DATA
#       CAPTURE. The operator, 2026-09-24, on bringing up OTV4TEST boxes under
#       the day_trader_pro conductor: "Make the s3 push compatible with the
#       conductor through a toggle in configure.sh call it 'managed' or
#       'standalone' data capture", "Have the same toggle switch off the cleanup
#       for 'managed'", "Have the same toggle switch off the VIX logging".
#
#   managed     the conductor owns this box's data. Enables what it drives, by
#               the EXACT names its quiesce/rearm and close use (1-REPORTER,
#               dtp 3003ac4: eod_conductor_v2.py:215/:227/:251):
#                 s3-push.timer (unmasked, installed, OT_INSTRUMENT given to the
#                 unit so the box pushes under its OWN symbol from minute one -
#                 own_symbol() otherwise falls back to sym=UNKNOWN until the
#                 first OHLC file, and the conductor's sweep culls unknown
#                 symbols), candle-logger.timer, optbot-self-close.timer (the
#                 16:45 backstop for a night control never arrives).
#               DISABLES optbot-retention-purge.timer - the conductor runs the
#               same purge at 16:05 on every box (eod_conductor_v2.py:493); two
#               schedulers for one job is r256's founding shape. The shared flock
#               (data/retention_purge.lock) would serialize them anyway.
#               Needs /usr/bin/python3 + boto3: s3-push and the conductor's
#               `--verify` run under the SYSTEM interpreter, not the venv.
#   standalone  this box pushes nothing: s3-push disabled and MASKED (the
#               reference QQQ box must never write into sym=QQQ, §38.3),
#               candle-logger and self-close off, our own 16:05 purge on.
#   status      which mode the UNITS are in - read from systemd, never from a
