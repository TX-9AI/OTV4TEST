# deploy/install_midnight_halt.sh — v1.1
# v1.1  2026-09-11  OTV4TEST r14 — moved from the repo root to deploy/ (root cleanup); no behaviour change.
# v1.0 (2026-09-06) — r289 / EOD.3. Installs the midnight ET backstop.
#
# Operator: *"I do sometimes work on them late & might forget. So I want another
# self shutdown at midnight eastern time to catch anything I accidentally left
# up. No drain, or anything else. Just stop, that's it."*
#
# 🔑 THIS SITS BELOW `optbot-self-close.timer`, NOT BESIDE IT. That one runs at
# 16:45, drains to S3, verifies, and deliberately STAYS UP IF SHORT. This one
# runs at 00:00 and only halts. Seven hours apart, so they cannot race, and the
# later one carries none of the earlier one's machinery — a backstop that can
# hang is not a backstop.
#
# ⚠️ EVERY DAY, NOT Mon-Fri. The 16:45 close is weekdays because that is when a
# session ends; this exists because a box was left up by hand, and that happens
# on a Saturday as easily as a Tuesday. A Sunday afternoon spent on the fleet is
# exactly the case the operator described.
#
# Run:  bash install_midnight_halt.sh
