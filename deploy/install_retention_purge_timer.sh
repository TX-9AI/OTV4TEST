# deploy/install_retention_purge_timer.sh — v1.1
# v1.1  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r53. THE PURGE GOES NIGHTLY, 16:05 ET, BY INSTRUCTION.
#       Operator: "You can make it a nightly purge, but have it run at 1605."
#       🔴 AND THE CADENCE WAS FIRST CHANGED BY HAND ON THE LIVE UNIT, WHICH IS
#       DRIFT AND NOT A FIX. check_retention_timer reads THIS FILE, not the running
#       unit, so it stayed green while the box disagreed with it and the next
#       install would have reverted the instruction silently. Same shape as r52's
#       per-connection WAL pragma: applied to the running instance instead of to
#       the thing that recreates it. THE INSTALLER IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
# v1.0  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r27 (BOX.4). THE RETENTION PURGE, WEEKLY, SATURDAY 08:30 ET.
#
# 🔑 NIGHTLY 16:05 ET SINCE r53. Operator, 2026-09-18: *"You can make it a nightly
# purge, but have it run at 1605."* ⚠️ AND HE GATED IT — *"BEFORE YOU INSTALL ANY
# TIMERS, YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH [the WAL] FIRST"* — because a nightly purge against
# an unbounded WAL just purges more often into a file that still grows. r52 pinned
# journal_size_limit at 128 MB; this cadence is installed after that, not before.
# 🔴 THE WEEKLY CADENCE WAS THE BUG, NOT A PREFERENCE (BOX.7): retention policy here
# is THREE DAYS and the timer ran ONCE A WEEK. The fleet has no purge timer at all —
# it trims as step 4 of self_close.py's 16:45 EOD takedown — so when this box was cut
# off from the warehouse and lost self_close, it silently lost the nightly purge
# riding in the same chain. 16:05 is after the cash close, inside the 08:00-00:00 up
# window, and keeps each night's delta small: the purge COSTS DISK BEFORE IT FREES
# ANY (measured 3.4 -> 2.0 GB free mid-run), so a box that has fallen behind cannot
# purge its way out.
#
# Operator, 2026-09-14 (the original ruling, superseded on cadence only): *"I want
# the purge put on a timer. Let's try Saturday after
# the automatic 8AM wake."* And on what it is: *"The retention purge is safe to run
# anytime any day because its intent is designed to flush out everything except
# the minimum necessary to preserve ramps that serve tenors. Trades should be
# excluded from that purge entirely."* — verified in warehouse/retention_purge.py:
# `trades` and every ledger are in NEVER_PURGE; trades.db only gets the reclaim's
# WAL checkpoint and gated vacuum, never a DELETE.
#
# 🔑 WHY THIS BOX NEEDS ITS OWN. On the fleet the purge rides `self_close` at 16:45
# after an S3 drain. This box does not drain (BOX.1, by ruling) and self_close is
# not installed, so NOTHING trimmed its stores — the only purges it ever had were
# a checker's side effect (HYG.10). This runs the purge ALONE: no drain, no stop,
# no shutdown. The midnight halt stays the box's only way down.
#
# ⚠️ 08:30, NOT 08:00. The EventBridge wake starts the instance at 08:00 ET; the
# bot and the feed come up behind it. Thirty minutes lets boot settle so the purge
# is not competing with a cold start for the disk. The purge's own lock and
# 120 s busy timeout (r256) already make a busy store a report, not a failure.
#
# ⚠️ Persistent=true, THE OPPOSITE OF THE MIDNIGHT HALT, ON PURPOSE. A missed
# midnight halt must never replay at the next boot — it would stop a morning box.
# A missed purge replaying at the next boot is harmless by the operator's ruling
# ("safe to run anytime any day"), and without it one failed Saturday wake would
# silently skip a week.
#
# ⚠️ --apply AT THE CALL SITE (r162): a purge without it is a dry run that deletes
# nothing and logs the same line forever.
#
# ⚠️ OnCalendar CARRIES THE ZONE. The box clock is UTC; `America/New_York` makes
# systemd track DST (verified with systemd-analyze on systemd 259: 12:30 UTC on
# 2026-10-31, 13:30 UTC on 2026-11-07 — 08:30 ET both).
