derived/anchors.py  v1.3
v1.3  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r103 - `nearest_tine` READ A TABLE THAT IS
      GUARANTEED EMPTY AND RETURNED None ON EVERY ROW EVER WRITTEN. It queried
      level_ledger for fork1h/%; r19's clause (1) makes _sources() skip every
      pool flagged `moving` so that a rail NEVER becomes a ledger row. MEASURED:
      0 fork1h rows in level_ledger, 83 in level_event, and
      SweepCreditSpread.anchor_tine_to_level banked 639 rows, all None.
      Repointed at the live projection. NEW `rail_context()` carries the rail
      distance, slope and convergence onto the plan row - ALL NUMERIC, because
      stamp() floats its values and plan_check has no text column, which is
      r99's price_vs_vwap defect in a new costume.
v1.2  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r94 — BOTH READERS STOP QUERYING A ROW NOBODY WRITES.
      `vwap_now()` AND `vwap()` both pinned `interval='primary'` - the FALLBACK
      row in indicators.derive(), emitted only `if not rows`. r69 repaired the
      per-timeframe loop, the fallback stopped firing, and both readers spent
      TWO DAYS on a dead row. MEASURED: 882 rows each for 5m/15m/1h/1d all
      carrying a VWAP; `primary` last seen 09-20 13:29 ET, the minute r69
      landed; the engine reporting 412 runs and ZERO failures throughout.
      They now read the newest row carrying a VWAP on ANY interval, and
      `vwap_now()` validates the anchor against the 09:30 open.
      I FIXED `vwap_now()` FIRST AND MISSED `vwap()` - the bug moved one
      function down the file - and A4 caught it on the next run.
v1.1  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r25 — THE VWAP READ WAS DEAD, AND ONE ANCHOR NOW DECIDES.
      🔴 `vwap()` queried interval '1m', which indicator_series has NEVER held —
      the engine writes 'primary' only — so it returned None on every call and
      `anchor_vwap_minus_pin` was null on 723 of 723 of Friday's butterfly rows.
      Re-pointed to 'primary'. ⚠️ THE FIRST ANCHOR PROMOTED TO A DECISION INPUT,
      on the operator's ruling (BFLY.5): `vwap_now()` feeds the butterfly's VWAP
      band. It is a SEPARATE reader because "latest row" is not "now": the
      engine keeps writing the last session's VWAP after the close (Sunday
      evening's rows carry Friday's 715.45, anchored Friday midnight). So it
      returns a value only when the row is anchored at TODAY's midnight ET and
      its bar is fresh; anything else is None with the reason, never a stale
      number. `vwap()` stays record-only and unfiltered.
v1.0  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r12 — ANCHORS: DERIVATIVES RECORDED ON THE PLAN ROW,
      NEVER DECIDED ON. Operator: *"record in our newly crafted plans, not to
      decide, but to see if they offer fitting anchors we can tie to later."*
      Every plan stamps 3–5 of these on its row every tick as record-only
      checks (verdict None), so an anchor is scored against fires, declines
      AND holds — fire_snapshot alone could only ever see the fires.

      Every read is best-effort and returns None when the store, table or
      row is absent; a None is a fact about coverage, not a failure. Nothing
      here raises into a plan.

      READS (all from stores that already exist):
        charm_at / vanna_at / gex_at (strike)  — surface_series, latest row
        vwap ()                                 — indicator_series (primary), latest
        vwap_now (now)                          — the same, ONLY if today's and fresh
