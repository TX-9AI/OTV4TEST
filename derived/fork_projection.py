THE 1-HOUR PITCHFORK'S RAILS AS A PROJECTION — SEPARATE FROM THE LEVEL BOOK.

v1.1  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r114 — fork_key is the anchors' PRICES + KINDS, not `idx`,
      which is a position in the rolling frame and shifted every bar.
v1.0  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST LVL.15 step 3 (unlanded WIP, built for review).

🔴 THE OPERATOR'S RULINGS, FINAL:
  · *"The pitchfork is a sloped channel projected over time & may be transient,
    or not present & its presence should be polled every tick. The projection
    is what should inform the Plans that use it. If the pitchfork is absent,
    the plan should be informed that there isn't one. It's a secondary
    contributor of a moving level entirely separate from the historical
    extremes in the level ledger."* (2026-09-22)
  · *"If it's more complicated than that, you're doing it wrong."*
  · For TRADES a rail is *"a valid accept or reject point because of that
    channel being respected, that is a legitimate place to sweep"* — SOFTER
    than a held level (r104: held first, rails after). (2026-09-23)
  · THE TINE RULE (r5, proven at r103): the upper rail is resistance only, the
    lower rail support only, the median by the side price is on; a rail on the
    wrong side of price is NOT a candidate and is never relabelled.
  · A new fork is a new projection (r19): identity is the three anchors.

WHAT IT IS: pure functions over one `analysis.pitchfork.Fork` and the 1h bar
index "now". Nothing is stored and nothing has a level id — a sloped line has no
fixed price to key on (r19's 22 ghost rows came from pretending it did).
HELD/BREACHED at a rail come from `derived/level_rules`, judged against the
rail's price AT EACH CANDLE'S OWN MINUTE — the same rules as a level, the same
module, so "held" means one thing everywhere.

REPLACES `LevelEngine.tines_now` / `rail_projection` / `_fork_key` in
`derived/levels.py`, which lived inside the level engine and therefore could not
be deleted with it.
