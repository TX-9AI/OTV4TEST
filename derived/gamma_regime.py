derived/gamma_regime.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-16  OTV4TEST r31 (BFLY.7) — THE DEALER-GAMMA REGIME AS A
      CONTINUOUS RAMP INPUT, RECORDED AND APPLIED AT ZERO WEIGHT.

WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND THE ONE MEASUREMENT THAT ARGUES FOR IT.
The butterfly is a bet that dealer gamma PINS price. It already reads the pin
STRIKE, the CONCENTRATION at that strike, the VWAP band (BFLY.5) and EM reach.
It has never read whether the pinning REGIME exists or is collapsing.

Measured on this box 2026-09-16, and the two numbers disagree for six hours,
which is the whole argument that this is a different axis and not another vote:

    pin concentration (what the fly reads)   0.06 - 0.17   NEUTRAL, weak all day
    chain net gamma   (what it did not)      +71M -> +123M strongly pinning

Then at 15:00 ET net gamma crossed ZERO — a -129M swing in fifteen minutes —
and QQQ went 709.65 -> 700.00 in the following twenty. The fly's protection is a
PREMIUM stop, which prices the damage after the tent is left; the regime crossing
zero is the CAUSE, and it is observable first.

🔴 SUMMING `surface_series.gex` IS WRONG, AND I DID IT ONCE BEFORE CHECKING.
`derived/surface.py:133` reads `net_gex` off the GEXSnapshot — the CHAIN TOTAL —
and writes that same value onto EVERY strike row (195 of them on 2026-09-16).
So one row per timestamp IS the whole reading, and a `SUM(gex)` multiplies it by
the strike count. The first pass at this measurement reported +13.8B where the
figure was +71M. The sign and the zero crossing survive a constant multiple, so
the finding held, but the description did not.
⚠️ CONSEQUENCE, RECORDED RATHER THAN WORKED AROUND: per-strike GEX is NEVER
PERSISTED. The strategies read it live from the snapshot, so nothing is broken
today, but no post-hoc study of pin STRUCTURE is possible from this table or
from the warehouse. A gamma FLIP LEVEL (the spot where cumulative GEX crosses
zero) cannot be computed here — only the chain net through time. Filed BFLY.8.

SIGN CONVENTION IS THE REPO'S OWN, NOT MINE — `data/gex_data.py:61`:
    "net_gex_total — sum across all strikes. Positive = pinning, negative = trending"

🔑 THIS SHIPS AT ZERO WEIGHT (WORKING_AGREEMENT §31, §39.2).
`GAMMA_RAMP_WEIGHT` defaults to 0.0, so `ramp()` returns exactly 1.0 and NOTHING
changes size. The score and the multiplier it WOULD have applied are stamped on
every plan row as anchors, so the counterfactual accumulates against fires,
DECLINEs and HOLDs alike. Turning it on is one constant, after the corpus rules.
⚠️ AND THE OPERATOR'S STANDING PREFERENCE IS A RAMP, NOT A GATE (2026-09-16):
"I'm not typically looking for gates unless there is a very strong case for a
block, I would almost always prefer a ramp in almost all cases." So `ramp()` is
continuous and its FLOOR is deliberately non-zero — a weak regime makes the
trade SMALLER, never absent, and a trade that still fires keeps producing data.

GATE CATEGORIES (§36) — for when the weight is ever raised:
    GAMMA_RAMP_WEIGHT   SELECTION   — a size preference, relaxable
    GAMMA_RAMP_FLOOR    SELECTION
    GAMMA_RAMP_CEIL     SELECTION
    GAMMA_SCALE_M       SELECTION   — the normaliser, a declared prior
Nothing here is FOUNDATIONAL or FEASIBILITY: at zero weight it decides nothing,
and at any weight it scales rather than refuses.

⚠️ THE SLOPE IS NOISY AND SAYS SO. Consecutive 15-minute readings on 2026-09-16
ran +33.6, -28.1, +21.0 BEFORE the real break. A raw slope would whipsaw, so
`slope()` is a least-squares fit over a window rather than a difference of two
points, and callers are expected to treat the LEVEL and its ZERO CROSSING as the
firm reading and the slope as the soft one.

Every read is best-effort and returns None when the store, table or row is
absent (the `derived/anchors.py` contract): a None is a fact about coverage, not
a failure, and nothing here raises into a plan.
