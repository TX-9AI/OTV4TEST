derived/indicators.py  v4.4
v4.4  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r101 — r96's COLD-START REBUILD WAS CALLED WITH AN
      EMPTY SYMBOL, AND FELL THROUGH IN SILENCE WHEN IT CAME BACK EMPTY. It
      read `self.symbol`, but `derive()` resolves `self.symbol or
      ctx["symbol"]` precisely because the attribute can be BLANK - so
      `fetch_candles("", "1m", 420)` returned nothing, the sixty-bar tick
      frame was folded anyway, and the engine reported 745.4476 against a
      true 744.7949 with the anchor still reading 09:30. The repair r96
      shipped could not run on the path that needed it. TWO HALVES: the
      symbol now comes from the CALLER, and an empty deep fetch WARNS rather
      than passing a partial window on in silence (SS0.5). GATE: A8, A9.
v4.3  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r96 — A COLD START REBUILDS FROM THE TAPE, AND r94 WAS
      HALF A FIX. r94 anchored VWAP at the 09:30 open, but the live tick frame
      is SIXTY BARS - measured 2026-09-22 13:53 ET, 12:55->13:54 - so a cold
      start folded one hour and stamped it with a session anchor: 745.4264
      against a true 744.7697. WORSE THAN THE BUG r94 FIXED: a mismatched
      anchor FAILS CLOSED and says why, a partial window PASSES and feeds the
      butterfly's waiver a plausible wrong number. On a fresh anchor it now
      deep-fetches 420 1m bars - the same idiom the ORB engine already uses
      via rebuild_from_tape - and REPORTS WHERE THE FOLD REALLY BEGAN, so a
      short session fails the reader's own test by construction.
v4.2  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r94 — VWAP ANCHORS AT THE SESSION OPEN, NOT MIDNIGHT.
      Operator, twice: "don't anchor VWAP to midnight" and "I want the VWAP
      anchored correctly". `idx[-1].normalize()` returned MIDNIGHT of the bar's
      day, folding overnight and pre-market prints - thin, away from the
      session's value area - into a number the butterfly reads as today's VWAP.
      Bars before the open are skipped by the existing `ms < anchor_ms` guard,
      so `vwap` stays None until 09:30 ET, which is correct rather than a gap.
Owns `indicator_series`. Tier 1 — path-dependent values.

v4.1  2026-09-20  OTV4TEST r69 (IND.1) — THE PER-TIMEFRAME LOOP HAD NEVER RUN.
      `list(trend.votes)` on a Dict yields its KEYS, so every vote was a string,
      every `getattr(vote,"timeframe")` was None, and the loop skipped all of
      them. 0 of 18,529 rows ever carried an EMA and every row was
      `interval='primary'`. One line: `.values()`. FORWARD-ONLY — history stays
      null. Gated by tests/check_indicator_votes.py.

v4.0  2026-08-22  See docs/DERIVED_STORES.md.

ADX, ATR, EMAs and VWAP. All four share one property: **recomputation is not
idempotent.** Each depends on where its window started, so the number an engine
sees can differ from the number it saw an hour ago for reasons that have
nothing to do with the market.

🔴 THIS IS NOT THEORETICAL. Friday 2026-08-21's rejection logs show ADX
swinging 16 -> 48 on the same symbols across ticks. Some of that is real. Some
may be window artifact, and **there is currently no way to tell** — nothing
keeps the series to compare against. `adx_at_entry` is a column on every trade
and `CONT_BREAKOUT_MIN_ADX` is a live gate, so if there is a recompute wobble,
both the gate and the study are contaminated by it. This table is what makes
that answerable.

🔴 VWAP STORES ITS ACCUMULATORS, NOT JUST THE VALUE. Sum(p*v), Sum(v) and the
anchor they started from. VWAP is cumulative from a FIXED anchor, so it is the
one value where a wrong window does not produce noise — it produces a
different indicator that still looks like a smooth line near price. Nothing
about it looks broken. The accumulators are what make it verifiable later.

⚠️ THE VW.1 SCAR: five wrong layers of analysis, because VWAP orientation was
RECONSTRUCTED after the fact instead of recorded when it happened. Storing the
series turns that class of investigation into a lookup.

⚠️ READS WHAT THE ENGINES ALREADY COMPUTED. This does not re-derive ADX from
bars — `trend_engine` and `volatility_engine` already did that this tick, and
computing it twice would give two numbers for one moment, which is the exact
disease. It records THEIR values.
