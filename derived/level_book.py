derived/level_book.py  v1.2
THE ONE LEVEL BOOK: closed session extremes, walked by recency, grouped into
zones, judged HELD / BREACHED on the 1-minute tape by `derived/level_rules`.

v1.2  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r111 — TWO OPERATOR RULINGS, BOTH IN THE BOOK.
      (1) A LONE PRINT IS NOT A SESSION EXTREME ("1. Yes"): `spike_extremes`
      is ON by default at SPIKE_REJECT_USD $1.00 and judges OUTSIDE RTH ONLY —
      inside RTH the same shape measured as real fast flushes. 09-21's 725.75
      (08:25 ET, one print 2.45 under a market at 728.2, absent from his chart)
      leaves the book; Monday's pre-market low is 726.70. The overnight block
      STAYS ("2. Keep"). (2) "ANY LEVEL THAT'S INSIDE TODAY'S 5-MIN OPENING
      RANGE IS AUTOMATICALLY RETIRED": at the first 1m candle at/after 09:35
      every live level inside the 09:30-09:34 range retires TRAVERSED
      (`Book.traversed`) — r5's rule, which the v1.1 book path had dropped. On
      the real tape since 08-10 it fired 7 times and retired 12 levels. K13,
      K14. ⚠️ r110 LANDED WITHOUT THESE: its archive was parked before the
      rulings and never re-cut — found by the post-land marker check, before
      any bake, so no running process ever held r110's v1.1.
v1.1  2026-09-23  SESSIONS ON THE ET CLOCK, EXTREMES FROM THE MINUTE. v1.0 built
      blocks from HOURLY candles on the hour, so pre-market ended 09:00 and the
      09:00-09:30 half hour belonged to RTH. On 09-18 the real pre-market low
      (717.10, 09:27 ET — the operator's chart) fell into RTH, under a lower
      RTH low, and NEVER BECAME A LEVEL. `closed_sessions_et`: overnight
      20:00-04:00, pre-market 04:00-09:30, RTH 09:30-16:00, after-hours
      16:00-20:00, DST-safe; candidates are every 1m candle in the block plus
      every hourly candle WHOLLY inside it (an aggregate carries the true
      extreme of an hour whose minutes the seeded tape is missing); `build()`
      judges any hour with no 1m candle on its hourly candle. And
      `spike_extremes` + `spike_reject`: a lone-print filter, OFF (0.0) until
      the operator rules — the 09-18 08:14 candle printed 716.38 once, 1.80
      under the market, on the vendor's tape on BOTH QQQ boxes, and his chart
      does not show it. K11 (red on v1.0 through build()), K12.
v1.0  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST LVL.15 step 2 (unlanded WIP, built for review).

🔴 THE OPERATOR'S DEFINITION OF A LEVEL, FINAL (2026-09-22): *"a level is a
place where there's orders resting because it was outside of the extreme of a
session high or low. Starting most recently and working backwards."* And:
*"I don't give a rat's ass if it's New York or Asia or London — just get the
levels, the numbers."* A session STILL FORMING is not a level: a level becomes
live when its session CLOSES.

WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT IS A NEW FILE. `derived/levels.py` (1,334 lines)
and `derived/level_map.py` (379) grew by patch over r3..r106: three breach
definitions, depth tiers, touch counts, session labels in identity, a ledger
reconciled against the tape, and `level_map` importing the OLD mapper for its
session clock — the single import that kept two level systems alive. The
operator: *"Anything that has the word level in it needs to be erased ...
Literally start over."* This file imports neither.

REUSED, NOT REINVENTED — the parts that were measured and well built, COPIED
here so the old modules can be deleted without taking them along:
  · the HOURLY tape as the level source (r36: an hourly high/low is the true
    extreme of its hour; 1h reaches 60 days), RTH + `_EXT` merged (r29);
  · the zone width = the instrument's own median larger-side hourly wick,
    recomputed, never stored (r39: the ratio replicates across QQQ/MU/SPX, a
    percentage of spot does not);
  · zones merged to a FIXED POINT (r39: one pass printed an overlapping
    partition);
  · the recency walk (r29): newest first from the anchor, each older rung only
    if FURTHER out — at ZONE granularity, cluster first then walk (r39).

WHAT IS NEW, EACH BY RULING:
  · FOUR contiguous session blocks declared from the RTH boundary alone, so they
    meet by construction in either DST offset — 00->08Z, 08Z->RTH open, RTH,
    RTH close->24Z. The last is AFTER-HOURS (16:00-20:00 ET), which had never
    been a block (r107 patch finding); the EST 08:00-09:00 ET hole is gone.
  · NO LABELS: identity is side + price. Two sessions printing one price are one
    pool of resting orders, one level; the newest formation dates it.
  · HELD / BREACHED come ONLY from `level_rules` (one definition, 1m candles).
  · A ZONE stays live until its FAR edge is accepted; a breach retires every
    member (r39 kept); a close inside a zone is not HELD (ruling b, 09-23).
  · No grading, depth, touch counts, freshness or age gates.

⚠️ THE ONE PLACE THE HOUR STILL JUDGES, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. A level
formed before the 1m tape begins is judged on HOURLY candles until the 1m tape
starts. Hourly close-beyond + next hourly open-beyond IMPLIES the 1m rule, but
the converse fails (LVL.14: 39% of breaches missed or late), so such a level can
be alive here when the minute says dead. Every event carries `judged_on`, and
`Book.hourly_judged` counts the levels that depended on it. r108 keeps 1m for 60
days and the 2026-09-23 backfill reaches 08-24, so this shrinks to nothing as
the minute tape fills the hourly window.

PURE: no store is written, no clock is read; the same tapes give the same book.
