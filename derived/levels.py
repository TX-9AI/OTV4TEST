derived/levels.py  v6.6
v6.6  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r126 - THE LEGACY LEVEL PATH IS DELETED (LVL.15 step 5,
      the operator: "Yes, for sure" / "Yep, delete"). `derive()` publishes the
      book, and nothing else: the LEVEL_SOURCE switch, the legacy body of
      derive(), `_sources`, `_tape_sources`, `_reconcile`, `_derive_events`,
      `_walked`, `split_rails`, `pd_ts`, the legacy-only constants
      (TOUCH_TOL_PCT, ACCEPT_CLOSES, CLOSES_BACK, EXCURSION_MAX_BARS) and nine
      engine attributes only they touched are removed. Found by a reachability
      pass from the live roots (the book sync, the rails, board/tines_now/
      rail_projection/walk and the module functions other files import), not
      by reading: 21 functions are live, 7 were not. SHALLOW/DEEP_PIERCE_PCT
      stay - the book and rail syncs read them. derived/level_map.py, which
      only this path still imported, is deleted with it.
v6.5  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r124 - THE BOARD NO LONGER READS derived/level_map
      (LVL.15 step 5). `board()` grouped the book's levels into zones with
      `level_map.zone_width(self._tape)`, `level_map.zones` and `level_map.walk`,
      measuring the width from `ctx["level_tape"]` (main.py's hourly tape read).
      The SAME width is now taken from the book `_book_sync` builds every closed
      bar (`book.width`: level_book.zone_width over the same SYM+SYM_EXT hourly
      bars - MEASURED EQUAL on the live store, 828 bars, 0.5600 both), and the
      two dict-based helpers are MOVED here verbatim as `_zones`/`_walk`, so the
      board runs the same code on the same numbers. level_map is left to the
      legacy path alone, which r125 deletes with it.
v6.4  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r116 - the rails are read at the CURRENT minute:
      `tines_now` adds the fraction of the forming hour elapsed (from the
      ForkEngine's `last_bar_start`) to the bar index; the fork's life is the
      builder's containment test alone (forks v4.4).
v6.3  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r115 - A FORK'S DEATH BELONGS TO ITS BUILDER. r114 judged
      rail breaches HERE and kept a private dead-set, while the ForkEngine went on
      serving the same fork to every other reader. Operator: "it's gone when the
      engine says it's gone, not when a strategy says it's gone." The breach
      judgement, the dead-set, the INVALIDATED record and the restart restore all
      moved to derived/forks.py v4.3; this engine keeps only the TOUCHES (HELD ->
      REJECTED for the sweep) and reads the fork's identity from
      forks.fork_identity, the one definition.
v6.2  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r114 - THE RAILS ON THE OPERATOR'S DEFINITIONS. "Any
      interaction that doesn't cause the fork object to destruct is a touch. A
      breech is an event that invalidates the fork." The book path's rails no
      longer run the old _derive_events tine branch (0.15% close tolerance,
      depth-graded WICKED/REJECTED); `_rails_sync` judges each rail with
      level_rules at the rail's price on the closed bar's own minute: HELD ->
      REJECTED on the rail id (a legitimate sweep point, softer than a level);
      BREACHED -> the fork's identity is INVALIDATED, `tines_now` serves nothing
      for it again (board, projection, anchors all read "absent"), and the
      INVALIDATED row carries the identity so a restart cannot resurrect it (§22).
      AND `_fork_key` IS NOW THE ANCHORS' PRICES + KINDS: `idx` is a position in
      the rolling frame and shifted every bar (one fork wore 17 keys 09-09..09-14),
      so r19's identity fired hourly on the same fork (R7 pins it).
Owns `level_ledger` and `level_event`. Tier 3 — stateful; the object has a biography.
v6.1  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r111 — the two rulings reach the engine: LEVEL_SPIKE_REJECT
      now defaults to level_book.SPIKE_REJECT_USD ($1.00, ON; one number, config
      key LEVEL_SPIKE_REJECT overrides), and a level the book retired inside the
      day's opening range is retired TRAVERSED in the ledger, never BREACHED (E8).
v6.0  2026-09-23  LVL.15 STEP 2 — THE LEVEL BOOK IS THE SOURCE. With
      LEVEL_SOURCE "book" (the default) `derive()` stops computing levels and
      events itself: once per CLOSED 1m bar it rebuilds `derived/level_book`
      from the feed store's 1h+1m tape and PUBLISHES it — the ledger holds
      exactly the book's live levels (old rows retire NOT_A_LEVEL, breached
      ones BREACHED), HELD is written as REJECTED with the episode's deepest
      pierce (r44), BREACHED as ACCEPTED. The plans read the same two tables
      and are unchanged (step 3 retargets them). The old 0.15% close
      tolerance, ACCEPT_CLOSES count, opening-range TRAVERSED rule and zone-
      containing-spot retirement do not run on this path: the operator's
      definitions replace them. §37: only events from the last BOOK_FRESH_S
      (180s) are published, so a restart — which replays the whole book —
      never hands a plan an old trigger. THE RAILS ARE UNTOUCHED: they still
      take the r15..r104 path (`_derive_events(tines_only=True)`). "legacy"
      keeps the old path whole. Gate: check_level_engine_book E1-E7.
      ⚠️ FOUND BY MUTATION ON THE FIRST CUT: a HELD judged on the HOUR has no
      1m candle in its episode, max() of the empty span raised, and the whole
      sync failed — the ledger would have frozen through any hour-long 1m
      feed hole. The pierce now falls back to the hourly candles (E7).
v5.6  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r104 - `rails_after_held()` and `split_rails()`:
      ONE definition of the invariant every level-trading plan must honour -
      held extremes rank first, rails rank after. The KEY is the caller's,
      because the three plans rank differently and each is right for its own
      trade; a shared function that imposed one ordering would have broken two
      of them.
v5.5  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r103 - THE PROJECTION MAP: THE RAILS OUTWARD IN
      TIME. `rail_projection()` and `rail_projection_for()`. The operator has
      ruled this repeatedly - "the rails belong in a projection map so that you
      can go outward in time because you already know the slope of the channel
      if a fork is present". r19 BUILT the primitive: `tines_now(price,
      minutes_back)` walks a rail along its own slope so an interaction is
      measured when it happened. A NEGATIVE minutes_back walks it FORWARD, and
      nothing ever called it that way - so the slope, computed every 15s tick
      since the fork was built, has never once answered where a rail is going.
      Orientation is inherited from the tine rule, so a wrong-side rail is
      never projected; a dead fork yields an explicit absence.
v5.4  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r44 — THE PIERCE IS THE EXCURSION, NOT THE RECLAIM
      BAR'S WICK. `_derive_events` skipped every bar that traded beyond a level
      without closing back, so depth was measured on the ONE bar that closed
      back. ⚠️ THE BIAS RAN AGAINST THE BEST SETUPS: a one-bar wick measured
      correctly, a REAL grab always reported the shallowest bar of the sequence.
      Operator's case, 09-18 london 716.38: true 0.0688%, recorded 0.0102% —
      refused as "a touch, not a sweep" against a floor it cleared by 3.4x.
      MEASURED: of 182 banked REJECTED events, 58 under-reported by >1.5x and
      23 were refused when the true excursion cleared the floor.
v5.3  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r39 (LVL.13) — THE BOARD WALKS ZONES, AND A ZONE
      HOLDING PRICE IS FINISHED. Operator, 2026-09-17: *"it's just grouping and
      only the outer members of the group declare anything"*, *"only points of
      recording interactions is at the extremes of the cluster — nothing in
      between gets to declare anything"*, and *"when we have a breach of the
      cluster everything that was a part of the cluster needs to go with it."*
      Each rung now carries TWO recording prices: `near_edge`, which takes the
      touch, and `far_edge`, which takes the breach — and `zone_ids`, so the
      breach retires every member and not just the one price was at.
      🔴 `board()` NO LONGER PRE-THINS WITH `_walked()`, AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE
      DEFECT. r29's walk keeps the nearest level per direction-step, which is
      correct for single levels and DESTRUCTIVE before grouping: measured
      2026-09-18 on the live ledger, 43 rows became 21 and the six levels stacked
      on spot (716.75 … 718.04) became ONE before any zone could see them. The
      cluster has to form from everything the ledger holds; the walk then thins
      ZONES. Cluster first, walk second.
      ⚠️ A ZONE CONTAINING PRICE IS RETIRED TRAVERSED, not reported. Operator:
      *"'one zone containing spot' isn't a zone, then. It's done — as a zone is
      defined, it's finished. There's no reclaim trade for that."* It is judged
      on a CLOSED BAR and never a tick, because r5 ruled a wick never spends a
      level and retirement has no undo. The opening-range TRAVERSED rule is
      untouched and still runs at tick rate.
v5.2  2026-09-17  OTV4TEST r33 — ONE BOARD, THE FORK BESIDE IT, AND THE LEDGER
      EMPTIED OF WHAT WAS NEVER A LEVEL.
      🔴 VWAP IS NO LONGER A SOURCE. It wrote a `kind="dynamic"` row every tick
      keyed on the PRICE, so a moving average minted a new identity each time it
      moved — 844 rows, and NO READER HAS EVER SEEN ONE, because `live_levels()`,
      `board()` and `walk()` all filter `kind IN ('support','resistance')`. It is
      r19's defect in a second costume: a MOVING object given a FROZEN horizontal
      identity. VWAP stays available at `ctx["vol"].vwap`, where the butterfly's
      own band already reads it. r30's STALE_VWAP sweep — which existed only to
      clean up after this producer — is retired with it.
      🔴 THE LEDGER WAS CLEANED IN THE SAME REVISION, on the operator's
      instruction: 855 vwap/dynamic rows and 55 fork-rail remnants DELETED
      (1,016 rows to 107). The live tradeable count was 11 before and 11 after —
      the invariant that mattered, checked either side of the delete, with the
      table dumped to `/home/ubuntu/level_ledger_backup_*.sql` first. The 63
      pre-r29 ladder rows (prev_day, PDH/PDL, R1-R3) are LEFT as history: all
      retired, none live, and they were real levels once.
      ONE BOARD FOR EVERY PLAN THAT TRADES LEVELS, AND
      THE FORK IS A SECOND PRODUCT BESIDE IT, NEVER INSIDE IT. Operator 2026-09-17:
      *"Make every fucking trade that relies on levels get it from the same place
      and include the fork when present"* and *"the fork projection is separate
      from the levels map. Those are two separate products. Both are to be
      consulted. The fork is a common informer but not mandatory if it's not
      there."* That was already the ruling at r5 — *"LEVELS IN PLAY come from the
      derived store, NEVER A PRIVATE MAP: 3 named up, 3 named down, plus the 1h
      pitchfork's tines"* — and three plans had three private compositions of it:
      the hunt through `board()`, the sweep through a local `level_map.walk()`
      with the rails APPENDED INTO the level list, and the TCS through a raw
      `live_levels()` filtered to `provenance == "ny"` with no fork at all.
      🔴 `board()` IS NOW THE ONE ACCESSOR AND ITS ORB BOUNDS ARE OPTIONAL. With
      them it answers the hunt's question unchanged (levels BEYOND the opening
      range, measured outward from the edge — r12's reach, which is the hunt's
      own design and is not touched). Without them it walks from SPOT, nearest
      first, each older level further out — the operator's rule, and the same
      `_walked()` the ORB path already used, so this merges two compositions
      rather than adding a third.
      ⚠️ THE RAILS ARE NEVER IN `above`/`below`. They stay in `tines`, with
      `fork` reading "built" or "absent" — r19's co-inform-not-conjoin, which the
      sweep had rebuilt one layer up by appending them in memory at read time.
      `walk()` now DELEGATES here so there is one implementation, not two.
v5.1  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r30 — TWO DEFECTS IN r29, FOUND READING THE NOON BAKE.
      (1) A CONFIRMED LEGACY ROW KEPT ITS OLD `timeframe`. The reconcile stamped
      `created_ts` on a pre-r29 row the tape holds but not `timeframe`, which
      `upsert_level` never rewrites, so the 9 held rows on the box read `session`
      and not `session:YYYY-MM-DD`. The book-beyond-the-tape rule matches only
      `session:%`, so once Saturday's purge trims the 1m tape past 09-09, the held
      720.06 / 719.70 / 717.68 would have retired NOT_A_LEVEL. The kept row now
      gets its formation time AND its dated timeframe (`set_level_created`).
      (2) r29's changelog said the reconcile retires "stale VWAP ids"; it skipped
      every `dynamic` row, and 515 were live after the bake. Every VWAP id but the
      current one now retires `STALE_VWAP`. No level reader sees `dynamic` rows,
      so neither changes a trade — (1) prevents one silently losing its levels.
v5.0  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r29 (LVL.8, LVL.9) — THE SESSION LEVELS COME FROM THE
      TAPE, AND THE LEDGER IS RECONCILED TO IT EVERY CLOSED BAR. Operator: *"Levels
      are session extremes that held. Starting from spot, map the most recent up/down
      levels going backwards in time and further up/down from the recent ones. A
      level is spent if it didn't hold & price accepted through it."* — the rulings
      already on record in fork PLAN_SPEC §31.1 and mainline §38 / LVL.3 / LVL.17.
      (1) SOURCES. When main hands `ctx["level_tape"]` (the feed store's 1m tape,
      `SYM` and `SYM_EXT` merged) the session levels are `level_map.session_levels`
      — every CLOSED Asia/London/NY section's high and low on the mapper's own
      clock — that HELD, plus ledger rows formed BEFORE the tape begins (the book
      reaches further than the purged tape; §38 *"reach is what the ledger has"*).
      The mapper's pools (PDH/PDL, `(R1)` rungs, the named ladder) are NO LONGER a
      source: they were the wick-broken ladder, and at 09:10 ET they carried a
      single 715.42 print as `London High (R1)` beside the same price as `london`.
      (2) RECONCILE, once per new tape bar: a live row that is not a held tape
      level and not older than the tape is RETIRED — `ACCEPTED_THROUGH` at the bar
      the tape shows acceptance (an `ACCEPTED` event only when that bar is fresh, so
      history never fires a trade: LVL.17), otherwise `NOT_A_LEVEL`. That retires
      the r5 `fork1h/*` rails, the pre-r19 tine rows, stale VWAP ids and every
      duplicate the old producers left, and it cannot fight a restart: nothing is
      held in memory that the tape does not re-derive.
      (3) `created_ts` IS THE BAR THE EXTREME PRINTED ON, so the board's walk can
      order newest first. (4) `board()` and `walk()` WALK: newest held level each
      side of spot, older ones only if further out, then the board keeps what
      stands beyond each opening-range edge.
      ⚠️ WITHOUT `level_tape` IN ctx THE v4.6 SOURCES RUN UNCHANGED. Only the check
      fixtures take that path (main always supplies the key, None on a dead feed,
      which yields no session levels and retires nothing). Recorded as LVL.10: the
      `check_level_rejection` fixtures must move onto a tape and that branch go.
v4.6  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r19 — THE FORK PROJECTION IS SEPARATED FROM THE LEVEL
      BOOK. Operator, 2026-09-13: "I want the session extremes separated from the
      1-hr fork object... The job of the fork projection should be a co-informer
      and not conjoined. The projection should only persist as long as the one
      hour fork persists; if a new fork is born a new projection needs to be
      graphed and plotted. There should be no drift from when triggers fired.
      They should be recorded at the moment of the interaction and not in
      hindsight." Four changes, one per clause.
      (1) SEPARATION. `_sources()` SKIPS any pool flagged `moving`. `publish_tines`
      puts every active rail on the map as a named pool, and this loop admitted
      them into a book of HORIZONTAL levels where `_lid` bakes the price into the
      id — so ONE rail became a NEW LEDGER ROW EVERY TIME IT DRIFTED A CENT.
      Measured here: 22 simultaneously-live `1h upper tine` rows spanning 5.79
      points, none retired, including four positions of a fork that had already
      died and been superseded. Mainline reached the same fix from the other end
      (r378: "main.py also stops admitting a MOVING tine into a book of
      horizontal levels").
      ⚠️ r15 BELIEVED IT HAD CLOSED THIS and pinned it with "no fork1h/* row in
      the ledger" — but the mapper names its rails "1h upper tine", so
      `_is_tine()` was False and they entered through the POOL door. The canary
      was scoped to the name that had been REMOVED, not the one that REMAINED.
      (2) IDENTITY. `_fork_key()` is the held fork's three anchors (p0/p1/p2).
      `build_fork_contained` runs every derive, so the OBJECT is rebuilt
      constantly; the anchors are what say whether it is the same fork.
      (3) LIFETIME. On a change of `_fork_key` every tine pierce state is
      dropped. r15 dropped state only when a tine NAME vanished — and a reborn
      fork republishes the SAME three names at new prices, so that condition
      could never fire and a dead fork's interaction state was inherited by its
      successor.
      (4) NO DRIFT. `tines_now(price, minutes_back)` walks the rail back along
      its own slope, and the emitter reads it ONE BAR BACK because the extreme
      being judged is on `df.index[-2]`, the last CLOSED bar. Mainline measured
      the cost of getting this wrong (r377): for a clean touch the extreme sits
      ON the rail, so the reported depth was slope x bars_since — THE STALENESS
      OF THE TOUCH AND NOT ITS DEPTH, clearing the rejection floor on 57.9%% of
      samples from drift alone. `minutes_back=0` is byte-identical to r15.
      🔑 WHAT STAYS CONJOINED, DELIBERATELY: the rails are still READ beside the
      ledger's levels by the emitter and the board. That is the co-informing.
      What ends is the rail being STORED as though it were a level.
v4.5  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r18 — THE ACCOUNTING RAN PER TICK, NOT PER BAR, AND
      TWO TRADES WERE FIRING ON A WORD THAT DID NOT MEAN WHAT IT SAID. `derive()`
      is called EVERY TICK and the touch/acceptance block had NO BAR GUARD AT ALL
      (the one at `_derive_events` covers only WICKED/REJECTED). Three defects,
      each proven by DRIVING this engine rather than reading it, and each fixed
      to the operator's ruling of 2026-09-13.
      (1) A TOUCH WAS A POLL. One 5m bar polled 20 times scored touch_count=20.
      On this box: QQQ:PDH (R1):717.52 logged 399 touches in a 390-bar session,
      and 566 of 607 levels (93%) logged zero. RULED: one per CLOSED BAR. The
      guard is PER LEVEL, so a level created mid-session counts from its own
      first bar instead of inheriting someone else's.
      (2) ACCEPT_CLOSES=2 COUNTED TICKS AGAINST A 5m CLOSE. The same close was
      re-read every tick, so the SECOND TICK always satisfied it — ~15 seconds
      and ONE close, not two. Operator on moving to two 5m bars: "Hell no. 10
      minutes leaves us nothing actionable, the move is already long over."
      RULED and BUILT: the accounting runs on the CLOSED 1m BAR — the same bar
      the rejection fact already used, so this engine is finally on ONE CLOCK —
      which makes the same ACCEPT_CLOSES=2 mean TWO MINUTES, deterministic
      rather than accidental, and it is a real config key now.
      (3) THE RUN NEVER RESET ON AN INSIDE CLOSE. Only a touch — within
      TOUCH_TOL_PCT — cleared `beyond`, so a close that was plainly inside left
      the run standing: two excursions NINETY MINUTES APART, price six points
      inside for an hour between them, retired the level as ACCEPTED. RULED:
      a close back inside breaks the run.
      ⚠️ WHY THIS WAS NEVER COSMETIC: the runaway ARMS on ACCEPTED (§30), the
      TCS TRIGGERS on it (§34), and acceptance RETIRES the level — pulling it
      off the very board r15 had just repaired. Nothing flagged any of it:
      every gate was green and every existing level check passed.
      🔑 SUPERSEDES r18's bar_ts fix by subsuming it: the ACCEPTED row is
      stamped with the closed 1m bar it was judged on, so the literal "5m" is
      gone for a better reason than the one r18 gave.
v4.4  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r18 — THE ACCEPTED FACT COULD NOT SAY WHICH BAR MADE
      IT. The ACCEPTED emit site passed the literal string "5m" as `bar_ts` —
      the column whose declared job is "the CLOSED 1m bar that produced it" —
      while the WICKED and REJECTED sites both passed a real timestamp. All 10
      ACCEPTED rows on this box carried `bar_ts='5m'`; all 76 WICKED/REJECTED
      rows carried a bar. TWO CONSEQUENCES, BOTH SILENT. (1) `level_event`'s
      PRIMARY KEY is (symbol, level_id, bar_ts, event) and `insert_level_event`
      is INSERT OR IGNORE, so a SECOND acceptance of the same level was dropped
      with no error — the ledger under-reported acceptances and the under-report
      was invisible. (2) `tcs_plan` keys its once-per-event latch on
      (level_id, bar_ts); with `bar_ts` constant that latch degenerated from
      ONCE PER ACCEPTANCE to ONCE PER LEVEL FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROCESS.
      `sweep_plan` uses the identical idiom on REJECTED and was always correct —
      only the TCS's upstream fact was stamped with a constant.
      ⚠️ FRESHNESS WAS NEVER AFFECTED: `accepted_age_bars` is computed from
      `ts_epoch`, so ACCEPT_FRESH_BARS always read true. The defect is identity,
      not staleness, which is why nothing looked wrong.
      🔑 ACCEPTANCE IS JUDGED ON THE 5m CLOSE (the block above says why), so the
      stamp is the 5m bar's own timestamp — the bar that decided. The fallback
      when no frame is present carries the tick clock rather than a constant, so
      a degenerate tick can never collapse onto a key that already exists.
      FORWARD-ONLY: the 10 rows already written keep `bar_ts='5m'`.
v4.3  2026-09-12  OTV4TEST r15 — TWO LEVEL DEFECTS, mainline r364's fix ported in its
      own shape (one implementation for otv5). (1) A POOL IS CLASSIFIED BY SIDE:
      the detector wrote "high"/"low" and `live_levels()` filters
      support/resistance, so PDH/PDL and the whole R1/R2/R3 ladder were
      invisible to the hunt, the sweep and the TCS — above the live price is
      resistance, below is support, formation as the fallback. (2) A TINE IS
      NEVER STORED: `_tines()` is gone from `_sources()`; `tines_now(price)`
      computes the rails from the fork the ForkEngine holds right now (with a
      rate: `bars_to_contact`), and a dead fork yields nothing on the next read
      — there is no row to go stale. The emitter reads the tines beside the
      ledger's levels and drops their pierce state when the fork goes. (3)
      `board(price, orb_high, orb_low, limit)` — the level board the plans read
      (PLAN_SPEC §38): held levels beyond the opening range ordered outward,
      the rails, four distinct empty answers, `count` never padded.
v4.2  2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r5 — THREE RULINGS FROM THE SWEEP UNTANGLE.
      · THE 1H PITCHFORK'S TINES ARE LEVELS. Moving ones (time + slope), so
        they are keyed on the TINE, not the price: `fork1h/upper`,
        `fork1h/median`, `fork1h/lower` (the `_level_id` price part is fixed at
        0.00 for them), and the price is read at the bar from the fork the
        ForkEngine built (`forks.last_forks["1h"]`). WICKED / REJECTED /
        ACCEPTED accrue on the tine.
      · THE TINE RULE: a top tine can never be a floor, a bottom tine never a
        ceiling. Upper -> resistance only; lower -> support only; median ->
        whichever side price is on at the bar. A wick UP through the lower
        tine is not an event.
      · NO LEVEL INSIDE THE OPENING RANGE. Once the 09:30 five-minute bar has
        printed (ctx["orb"] carries orb_high/orb_low), every level with
        orb_low <= price <= orb_high is retired TRAVERSED — price has been
        through it — and leaves every consumer at once. Tines are exempt
        (they move; the rule is evaluated per bar for them instead: a tine
        inside the range at the bar emits nothing).
v4.1  2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r3 — THE REJECTION FACT, EMITTED ONCE, HERE. Before
      this the only thing in the tree that could see a wick through a pool was
      the sweep strategy's private rule; this engine read the 5m CLOSE and never
      a high or a low, so a rejection was invisible to the derived layer. Now,
      on every CLOSED 1m bar (iloc[-2], processed once per bar timestamp), for
      every live support/resistance level:
        · close beyond the level (outside tolerance)  -> `beyond` += 1; at
          ACCEPT_CLOSES (2, measured) the level retires ACCEPTED_THROUGH and
          an ACCEPTED event is written. Any pierce state is cleared.
        · wick beyond, close inside                    -> WICKED, with depth:
            shallow  pierce <= SHALLOW_PIERCE_PCT (the sweep's strict ceiling,
                     SWEEP_CS_MAX_REJECTION_PCT = 0.25%)
            deep     pierce <= DEEP_PIERCE_PCT (3x, the relaxed ceiling)
            beyond   deeper than that — the level is being TAKEN, not swept;
                     recorded, never rejected
          Operator, 2026-09-08: *"one on a shallow and 2 on a deep pierce just
          to be sure"* — closes back inside COUNT THE WICKING BAR'S OWN CLOSE.
          A shallow pierce is REJECTED on that bar; a deep pierce needs the
          next bar to close inside too. A close beyond in between clears it.
      Consumers read `DerivedStore.latest_rejection()`; nobody re-detects.
      Wicks are tests, closes are acceptance — the whole emitter is that line.

v4.0  2026-08-22  See docs/DERIVED_STORES.md.

🔴 THE OPERATOR'S RULING, 2026-08-22:
    "In a live session a touch count is a HELD level, and when it doesn't
     hold, that level is FINISHED."

A touch is a HOLD. `touch_count` is the length of a run that TERMINATES at the
break — not a score that accumulates forever.

⚠️ THE EXISTING CODE DOES NOT MODEL THIS. `LiquidityPool` carries `touch_count`
and `swept` as separate fields, so a pool can read five-touch AND swept at the
same time — the count survives its own invalidation. Here the break is a
RECORDED EVENT: `retired_ts` + `retired_reason`, after which the level is
history and stops competing for attention.

🔴 BODIES DECIDE, WICKS TEST — universal convention, operator 2026-08-22, taken
from the sweep rules whose own doctrine says it plainly:
    `closes_beyond >= ACCEPT_CLOSES` is no longer a sweep — it is a BREAKOUT.
A wick through a level is a TEST. A close through is ACCEPTANCE.
⚠️ MEASURED, NOT INVENTED: closes_beyond >= 2 blocked 64.5% of named-pool
sweeps (2026-08-15). And it already fixed this exact defect once — the old
`rejection_pct` measured wick-to-last-close and STAMPED A BREAKOUT AS A
CONFIRMED SWEEP, which is precisely the error a wick-based rule produces.

🔴 NY IS THE DANGEROUS SESSION and the operator has been bitten by it. It is
the only session that is LIVE while being traded; Asia and London are closed
and final by the time an RTH box reads them. So "store once at session close"
is WRONG for NY. The resolution is the operator's own framing: **do not read
session fields at all.** Walk outward from price and report the first level
each way WITH ITS PROVENANCE — the session becomes a LABEL ON THE ANSWER, not
the query. A still-forming NY high that is nearest above genuinely IS the level
that matters, because that is where the stops are. `is_live_session` marks it
as still forming so nothing mistakes it for settled.

        rails belong in a projection map so that you can go outward in time
        because you already know the slope of the channel if a fork is
        present"*, and r19's clause — *"the projection persists only as long as
        the one hour fork persists and if a new fork is born a new projection
        must be graphed"*.

        🔑 THE PRIMITIVE ALREADY EXISTED AND WAS ONLY EVER WALKED BACKWARD.
        r19 built `tines_now(price, minutes_back)` to walk a rail along its own
        slope so an interaction is measured at the instant it happened. A
        NEGATIVE `minutes_back` walks it FORWARD. Nothing ever called it that
        way, so the slope — computed every tick since the fork was built — has
        never once answered "where is this rail going to be".

        ⚠️ ORIENTATION IS THE TINE RULE AND IT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE (r5): an upper
        rail is resistance forever, a lower rail support forever, the median by
        the side price is on. A rail on the wrong side of spot is DROPPED by
        `side_ok`, never relabelled — price above the top rail does not acquire
        a floor. The projection inherits that: it projects only rails that are
        correctly oriented RIGHT NOW.

        ⚠️ A DEAD FORK YIELDS `{}`. There is no stored row to go stale — the
        projection dies with the fork that graphed it, by construction.

    is a fixed price with resting stops beyond it; a fork rail is a sloped line

    the TCS ranks by ABSOLUTE distance and does NOT filter by side (after the
    move the accepted high sits BELOW price and is exactly what it sells
    against), and the hunt orders outward from the ORB edge. A shared function
    that imposed one ordering would have broken two of them.
