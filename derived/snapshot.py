derived/snapshot.py  v4.6
v4.6  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r99 — THE VWAP CONTEXT REACHES THE SNAPSHOT AT LAST.
      `price_vs_vwap` was NULL on EVERY ROW EVER WRITTEN, back to 09-09:
      volatility_engine sets "ABOVE"/"BELOW"/"NONE", a CATEGORICAL, and the
      payload ran _f() on it - float("ABOVE") raises, _f swallows it, the
      column stores None. Computed every tick for weeks and discarded at
      this boundary. Now records the VWAP NUMBER from anchors.vwap_now()
      (session-anchored, fails closed), a SIGNED vwap_dist_pct, the
      categorical AS TEXT, and vwap_source naming WHICH of the two VWAPs in
      this tree answered - they differed by 4.86 points when measured.
      AND vwap_slope_pct, because DISTANCE CANNOT SEPARATE a real extension
      from a fake one. Operator: "We're OK with buying into the beginning of
      an extension and riding it for as long as it holds. What I'm not OK
      with is buying a fake extension... it's OK that it's extended as long
      as it's pulling everything up with it." A real extension DRAGS THE
      MEAN; a fake pokes out against a flat VWAP. RECORDED, NOT GATED.
v4.5  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r51 — the three fields now actually READ, because
      `_flow_conn` gained a producer in the same revision. Without it
      `flow_imbalance`, `flow_tagged_frac` and `book_depth` would have written
      NULL on every row while looking correct.
v4.4  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r51 — THE THREE A STOP RUN CANNOT MANUFACTURE:
      `flow_imbalance` / `flow_tagged_frac` / `flow_prints`, `gamma_regime`
      (the [-1,+1] pinning-trending score, NOT raw `gex` and NOT the
      `gex_environment` classification), and `book_depth`. These are BRK.1's
      surviving entry gates, and gating on them without recording them would be
      this module's own founding defect for the fourth time (r240/r243/r244).
      ⚠️ NONE OF THEM CAN BE BACKFILLED — prints purge in three days and the
      regime is a rolling baseline. The operator's head-to-head starts Monday;
      every session without these is a session whose "why" is unrecoverable.
      ⚠️ VOLUME EXPANSION IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT: measured over 736 fleet
      breaks it does not separate (best lift 1.08x), because a stop run
      manufactures it.
v4.3  2026-09-04  r244 — 🔑 ALL THREE PIN MEASURES, NOT ONE.
      `pin_concentration` (29% fail) and the GEX environment behind `pinning`
      (53% fail) GATE every butterfly fire and NEITHER has ever been tested
      against an outcome — both live in `plan_check` with no `trade_id`, so
      nothing can join them to a P&L. Operator, 2026-09-04, on whether any
      measure of pin strength has been validated: none has.
      🔴 INSTRUMENTING ONLY THE EM FRACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN USELESS
      — a study could conclude "EM predicts nothing" while the real signal sat
      in a field nobody recorded, and that negative would be believed.
      ⚠️ RAW, NOT THRESHOLDED. The gate's pass/fail is already in `plan_check`;
      what is missing is the VALUE, and a study cannot fit a boundary it can
      only see one side of.
      ⚠️ SEPARATELY, NOT COMPOSITED — r224's lesson: a composite that separates
      tells you nothing about WHICH PART did the work.
      ⚠️ CONTEXT FOR THE NEXT READER: `screen_entry_vectors` scored SIXTEEN
      point-in-time vectors over 152 runaway trades and the best separation was
      AUC 0.54, against a noise floor of 0.19 in its own fixture. It never
      covered these three. Nothing here is evidence yet; it is the first time
      the question can be asked.
v4.2  2026-09-04  r243 — 🔴 THE PIN AND ITS EM FRACTION JOIN THE
      PAYLOAD. Operator, 2026-09-04, after the stop-removal and window cases
      both failed on evidence: *"that leaves the EM variable as our last hope
      of raising our win rate."* It was UNANSWERABLE — `pin_em_fraction` gates
      every butterfly fire, `plan_check` carries it on every tick with NO
      trade_id, and this payload is keyed BY trade_id and carried no pin and no
      EM. So whether the 7 winners sat lower in the 0.30-1.00 band than the 13
      losers could not be asked.
      🔑 SAME SHAPE AS r240: a field computed, used for a DECISION, and never
      written where the OUTCOME could be joined to it. The bridge existed; it
      did not carry the field.
      ⚠️ DERIVED FROM ctx, NOT PLUMBED — `pin_strike` and `atm_iv` are already
      there and `expected_move()` is the strategy's own function, so this is
      the fraction THE GATE USED rather than a second definition of it.
      ⚠️ EMITTED FOR EVERY STRATEGY, not just the butterfly: the runaway and
      the ORB fire near pins too, and a field present only where someone
      expected to need it is a field no study can ask a new question of.
      ⚠️ None WHEN UNMEASURABLE, 0.0 FOR A PIN AT THE MONEY — opposite facts,
      and this file's contract is that absent stays distinguishable.
      ⚠️ AND IT CANNOT RAISE: `capture()` runs on every fill, so a study field
      that throws would cost a trade its snapshot for a number nobody needs
      live. S4 drives four degenerate contexts.
      ⚠️ NOTHING ACCRUES RETROACTIVELY — the 20 butterflies already banked stay
      unmeasurable. This starts the collection.
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Owns `fire_snapshot`. Everything derived at the instant a trade fired.

v4.0  2026-08-22  See docs/DERIVED_STORES.md.

🔴 THE OPERATOR'S PURPOSE, 2026-08-22: if shadow observers are rebuilt on this
repo it is to study **which derived indicators reveal any usable edge** — so
what is wanted is a snapshot of everything available at the moment of the fire.

That makes the study a JOIN:

    fire_snapshot JOIN trades ON trade_id

Derived indicators on one side, outcome and excursion on the other. "Did high
charm at fire predict a larger MFE?" becomes one query. Today it cannot be
asked at all.

⚠️ EXCURSION TELEMETRY IS UNAFFECTED AND LIVES ON A DIFFERENT AXIS.
`mfe_premium` / `mfe_bars` / `mae_premium` / `mae_bars` are properties of the
trade's LIFE and stay on `trades`. This is one frozen instant at entry.
Different clocks, different tables, no collision — and the join is what makes
excursion work BETTER than it does today.

recorded label plus conviction and dropped every term that actually decided the
entry — so the journal had a vocabulary of two for a decision made on twenty.
If the point is DISCOVERING which indicator reveals edge, pre-selecting the
columns defeats the exercise before it starts.

⚠️ ABSENCE IS RECORDED EXPLICITLY. A value that was unavailable at fire time is
written as null — NEVER omitted, NEVER zero. A missing indicator and an
indicator that measured zero are different facts, and the whole VW.1 saga was
that distinction going wrong across five layers.

⚠️ WHY A JSON PAYLOAD RATHER THAN COLUMNS. The indicator set will keep growing
— order of 60-100 fields — and every addition would otherwise be a migration on
a table that already carries 75 columns and an `entry_snapshot` JSON escape
hatch. `trades` stays about the trade; this stays about the world at that
moment. Promote a field to a real column when a study proves it earns one.

            #     and cannot answer the question actually being asked — HOW
            #     EXTENDED was the entry. A continuation trade is definitionally
            #     a bet on extension, so distance is the whole point.
            # (3) SOURCE: `vol.vwap` is a SECOND VWAP, a df_5m cumsum
            #     (`volatility_engine:223`) anchored to whatever the frame
            #     spans — not the session-anchored one r94/r96 repaired. Two

        # BRK.1's surviving gates, recorded RAW at fire time. This module exists
        # because of exactly one failure, three times over (r240, r243, r244): a
        # field COMPUTED, used for a DECISION, and never RECORDED — so
        # `pin_concentration` and the GEX environment gated every butterfly fire
        # and neither could ever be tested against an outcome. Gating BRK.1 on
        # regime, aggression and depth without recording them would be the
        # fourth.
        # 🔑 AND THE OPERATOR'S HEAD-TO-HEAD IS WHY IT IS URGENT RATHER THAN
        # TIDY. 2026-09-18: *"when we see them trade head-to-head, we're gonna
        # uncover the why — why the liquidity hunt is better than the breakout
        # for conditions X Y & Z."* Outcomes alone answer "which won". Only the
        # CONDITIONS answer "when". None of these three can be backfilled:
        # prints purge in three days, and the regime is a rolling baseline that
        # cannot be reconstructed after the fact.

        # that did not (best lift 1.08x). A stop run MANUFACTURES it, which is
