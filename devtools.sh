# devtools.sh  v3.3  — OTV4TEST box menu
# v3.3  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r37 — THE BAKE WAS HALF A BAKE. It restarted the BOT
#       only, and it never purged __pycache__ — the one thing the operating notes
#       name as "the single most common cause of I pushed the fix but it is still
#       broken". So r36's Quote subscription, which lives in candle_feed.py, could
#       not have taken from a menu bake, and any bake could serve stale bytecode
#       while printing a green line. Operator's sequence, adopted verbatim: stop
#       both, pull, purge, start the FEED first, then the bot, report both.
# v3.2  2026-09-17  OTV4TEST r34 — items 1, 2 and 3 run status.py and query.py at
#       the REPO ROOT again. r14 had moved them to tools/ and this menu followed;
#       the operator runs them by hand and the root is where he looks.
# v3.1  2026-09-17  OTV4TEST — EVERY CLAUDE SESSION THIS MENU STARTS IS A
#       REMOTE CONTROL SESSION. Operator's instruction: he drives these threads
#       from his phone, and a session started without it cannot be reached from
#       the chat thread. All four launch sites carry `--remote-control qqq-test`.
#       ⚠️ THE NAME IS PASSED EXPLICITLY AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT TIDINESS:
#       the flag's argument is OPTIONAL (`--remote-control [name]`), so on the
#       HAND OFF site — the only one that also passes a positional prompt — a
#       bare flag could swallow the whole of docs/HANDOFF.md as the session
#       NAME and hand Claude no brief at all. Naming it removes the ambiguity.
# v3.0  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r17 — THE MENU IS READ ON A PHONE. Reformatted to
#       control's shape: a 54-column rule, a title line, sections as " NAME:",
#       items as "  NN) label" — and every line fits 54 columns, because a label
#       that runs past the rule WRAPS in Termius and a wrapped menu is the one
#       misread at 09:35 (items 41 and 43 wrapped at v2.4). Colour is control's
#       exactly: the render prints PLAIN text and a sed pass paints the rules,
#       the title and the section headers, suppressed when stdout is not a TTY,
#       so no escape ever sits inside a label. NEW SECTION — CLAUDE CODE, adapted
#       to this box: HAND OFF (a fresh thread bootstrapped from docs/HANDOFF.md —
#       the operator's own brief, replacing the inherited v4 handoff of 2026-08-20
#       which named PORT_STATE.md and was stale by its own header),
#       REATTACH (the running session), RESUME (--continue), RESUME [other]
#       (--resume). A one-time docs/HANDOFF_NOW.md, when present, is POINTED AT
#       by one appended line rather than folded into the brief, so the brief never
#       drifts and the note expires by being deleted. Claude runs inside tmux here, always, so a dropped mobile
#       connection cannot kill a working thread; three of the four `exec`, which
#       is why the section says these items END the menu.
# v2.4  2026-09-11  OTV4TEST r14 — the operator readers live in tools/ (root cleanup);
#       REINSTALL TIMERS added under GIT & LAND for the one-time unit rewrite.
# v2.3  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r8 — BAKE runs `systemctl daemon-reload` before the
#       restart (the unit file changed on disk and systemd said so at r7's bake).
# v2.2  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r7 — PLAN ROWS and PLAN BOARD hush DORMANT rows
#       (recorded, not shown; add them back with the prompt).
# v2.1  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r6 — Feed health shows OPEN INTEREST: the last `OI:`
#       lines from the bot's journal (fetched / cached / NON-ZERO), so the
#       butterfly's un-park is a menu read, not a grep.
# v2.0  2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r4 — THE BOX MENU CATCHES UP WITH CONTROL.
#       Operator: this instance is standalone; control's devtools never reaches
#       it, and the box's own menu was the otv1-era break-glass list. The
#       control menu's BOT-SPECIFIC items are ported here to run LOCALLY —
#       SENSORS (the same SQL, over this box's own derived_store.db and
#       feed_store.db, an ET date prompt where control took one), DEBUG / LOGS,
#       and the R SUITE (the fork's own tests/r_ledger.py, stop_sweep.py,
#       exit_replay.py, edge_scan.py via their `--db` escape hatch on
#       trades.db — this box is masked from S3 by construction). Everything
#       about wrangling a fleet is deliberately absent. NEW sensors: PLAN ROWS
#       (the per-tick narrative) and LEVEL EVENTS (WICKED / REJECTED /
#       ACCEPTED, derived/levels v4.1, r3).
#       🔑 THE MENU IS DATA, as on control (dtp v1.32): MENU=(SECTION|… /
#       ITEM|label|function) rendered with numbers assigned at display time,
#       so nothing here cites a number — LAND and BAKE moved; their labels did
#       not. Existing functions are kept verbatim.
#       Version numbering restarts at 2.0 by the operator's request; the
#       v4.x lineage below is the file's history, not a downgrade.
# v4.4  2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r3 — LAND auto-selects a lone archive; BAKE added.
# v4.3  2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r1 — LAND a tarball (the fork lander).
# v4.2  2026-09-08  r322 — the comment markers (this script had done nothing
#       since 2026-08-25: a changelog line written as shell aborted the parse).
# v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM.  v4.0  2026-08-19  ported at the OTV4 split.

  # FEED first, then the bot, then report both.
  # 🔴 WHAT IT WAS MISSING AND WHY EACH ONE MATTERS:
  #   (1) THE BYTECODE PURGE. The migrated operating notes open with it — "Always
  #       purge the bytecode cache before restarting. This is the single most
  #       common cause of 'I pushed the fix but it's still broken'" — and the one
  #       command whose entire job is making a landed revision LIVE never did it.
  #   (2) THE FEED. It only ever restarted $BOT. r36 put the underlying's Quote
  #       subscription in data/candle_feed.py; a bot-only bake leaves that dead
  #       and the operator reading a green "baked" line that is only half true.
  #   (3) STOP BOTH FIRST, START FEED FIRST. The bot reads what the feed writes,
  #       so bouncing them independently can leave the bot querying a store no
  #       producer is filling. Down together, up in dependency order.
  # ⚠️ check_imports IS KEPT AND STILL BLOCKS, but it now runs while the services
  # are DOWN, so a tree that cannot import leaves the box STOPPED rather than
  # running yesterday's code. That is the honest direction — a bake that silently
  # leaves the old process up is the "LANDED ≠ BAKED" confusion r3 named — but it
  # is a change: a failed bake now needs a fix, not a shrug.

# Claude runs INSIDE TMUX on this box, always: the operator drives from a phone
# and a dropped mobile connection must not kill a working thread (the same rule
# that governs every long-running job here). The session name is fixed so
# REATTACH always knows where to look.
#   HAND OFF  a FRESH thread, bootstrapped with docs/HANDOFF.md so the
#             introduction is not re-typed; kills this menu and every tmux
#   REATTACH  the session that is already running; exits the menu, kills nothing
#   RESUME    `claude --continue` — the last thread on this box
#   RESUME [other]  `claude --resume` — its picker
# ⚠️ THESE ITEMS END THE MENU. Three of them `exec` into Claude, so the menu
# process is REPLACED, not suspended — there is no menu to come back to, which
# is the honest behaviour rather than a shell stacked under a shell.
