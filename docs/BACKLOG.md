# BACKLOG.md — OTV4TEST — v0.16

**The fork's own backlog. Started BLANK on 2026-09-08 by the operator's ruling:**
*"If you think we could benefit from a backlog it should start BLANK and be
specific to this repo."* Mainline's 3,986-line backlog is not this file and is
not carried; it lives in `TX-9AI/options_trader_v4` where its items are worked.

Same rules as mainline (WORKING_AGREEMENT §18): ships in every archive, one
row per item, a title bump and a PART 3 entry per delivery. Revisions are cited
as `OTV4TEST rN`, never a bare `rN`. States (the LAST cell, which `check_ledger_parity` reads): 🔲 OPEN · ◐ built/pushed, not yet
proven on the box · ✅ closed · ⬛ dead.

**BUILT ≠ PUSHED ≠ BAKED** — and on this box the third means running on the
isolated QQQ instance with the operator watching the plan ledger daily.

---

## PART 1 — OPEN

### ORB — the first trade untangled (PLAN_SPEC §29)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **ORB.1** | ⬜ **PROVE IT FIRES ON THE BOX.** The rewired ORB (OTV4TEST r2) has run on hypotheticals only. Acceptance (FORK_BRIEF §6): a live session in which every fire reads back against its plan row — stop = the impulsive candle's extreme, strike at ±width, the size the sizer produced against the provisional size the row showed. A null result is a result: a session of `HOLD PREPARED … waiting on: retest` with no retest is the tape, not a defect. Read `plan_tick` for `ORBStrategy` after the first session. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **ORB.2** | ⬜ **TWO SELECTION VALUES CARRIED, NOT RULED.** `strategy/orb_plan.py` declares `QUOTE_FLOOR = 0.05` (contracts marked at a nickel or less are not candidates) and `DELTA_BIAS = "lower"` (an equidistant tie goes further OTM). Both were silent inside `select_orb_strike` and are now readable values, parity-pinned so what the plan picks is what e955020 picked. The operator asked which strikes the plan should look for and agreed the rule; these two edges were named and not decided. Keep, change, or drop — one number each. | 🔲 OPEN |

### Runaway — the second trade untangled (PLAN_SPEC §30)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **RUN.6** | ⬜ (half, r12: participation is now READ from the prints at the boundary and recorded on the row; the composite still uses pace + acceptance until the first fires are scored) **PARTICIPATION IS NOT WIRED INTO THE STRENGTH READ.** §30.3 names three components; only pace and acceptance are measured at acceptance. The prints stream (aggressor side, r64) and `tape_at_level` exist but are not reachable from the strategy path; `runaway_plan.prepare(participation=...)` accepts the value and records None. Wire it as a dial, then re-read the band prior. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **RUN.7** | ⬜ **WOULD-HAVE-FLOORED WATCH.** The runaway has no premium stop by ruling; `exit_engine` records `_would_have_floored` the first time the old 20% floor would have fired while the thesis held. After the first sessions: how many trades, and did the structure exits recover them or not? A percent under the structure is a question, not a bar, until this is read. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **RUN.8** | ⬜ **THE FIZZLE PRIORS ARE UNMEASURED.** "Two events, or one event plus one dial", the 0.5× range-contraction line and the acc_recent < 0.5 read are declared priors; every read lands on the record (`_fizzle_read`). Score them against RAN (not 5% green) once fires exist; kill, keep, or codify. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **SWP.1** | ⬜ **REJECTION_FRESH_BARS = 3 IS A PRIOR.** "Decide quickly" needed a number; 3 bars is mine, config-overridable (`SWEEP_CS_REJECTION_FRESH_BARS`), recorded on every fire and every stale note. After the first sessions: did any fire beyond 1–2 bars, and did a 4th-bar rejection ever matter? | 🔲 OPEN |
| **SWP.2** | ⬜ **RICHNESS IS A DIAL WITH NO BAR.** Credit/width is on every prepared row. Read it against the fires before anyone proposes a floor. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **SWP.0** | ✅ (r5, PLAN_SPEC §31) **THE SWEEP CREDIT SPREAD IS NEXT.** Its trigger is the REJECTED fact (§30.1); its thesis is the level holds to the close; the condor forms from a second rejection on the other side. The afternoon-only gate is a clock standing in for the handoff (§30.5) and stays until the handoff has fired on real tape. | ✅ r5 |

### Butterfly (PLAN_SPEC §32)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **BFLY.1** | ⬜ **THE PERSISTENCE PRIORS ARE UNMEASURED.** `SMOOTH_WINDOW` 12 / `PERSIST_TICKS` 8 are mine; `pin_raw` and `pin_persist_ticks` are on every row. After the first real pins: how long does a real pin hold, how often does the mode flip, did the bar ever refuse a fly that would have paid? | 🔲 OPEN |
| **BFLY.2** | ⬜ **SPLIT `prepare()` INTO `strategy/butterfly_plan.py`** for parity with the other three trades — a tidy, not a behaviour; do it when the fly has fired once and the row shape is known. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **OI.1** | ⬜ **WATCH THE OI FETCH after v4.2** — no `fetch failed … Event loop is closed` lines; `fetched N … NON-ZERO` once per cycle with the whole chain. Feed health shows it. | 🔲 OPEN |

### TCS (PLAN_SPEC §34)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **TCS.1** | ⬜ **NICKEL CLOSE ON THE TCS — decide explicitly.** The 2026-08-14 ruling (no exit short of a breach or the hard close; EV measured held to expiry) stands in code; today's untangle listed a nickel in the exit order without revisiting that measurement. One ruling, one line in exit_engine. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **TCS.2** | ⬜ **THE EM GATE IS THE FIRST SUSPECT** either way (operator). Read `em_outside_by` on fires and `outside_by` on DECLINEs for the first sessions before touching anything else. `ACCEPT_FRESH_BARS` = 3 is a prior. | 🔲 OPEN |

### Condor (PLAN_SPEC §35)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **CND.2** | ⬜ **THE TENT CODE IS UNCALLED, NOT DELETED.** `check_and_execute_tent`, `_tent_breached`, `_execute_tent`, `_tent_close_all` and `_evaluate_tent` remain in the tree with no caller after r11. Delete them with the port (a dead branch reads as live). | 🔲 OPEN |
| **CND.1** | ⬜ **THE FIRST FORMED CONDOR IS THE TEST.** Every rung disposes every tick on the CondorManagement / CreditRoll rows; read the first real pairing end to end (formation row → tested by wick → roll search → whichever rung fires) before touching a number. The tent has no sample; each case is its own evidence. | 🔲 OPEN |

### Levels (PLAN_SPEC §38)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **LVL.1** | ✅ (r15) **THE LADDER COULD NOT LEAVE THE LEDGER; THE TINE ROWS WENT STALE.** Pools written `high`/`low`, filtered out by `live_levels()`; tine rows never retired. Found by the OTV4 thread on mainline's warehouse (786 rows, 2026-09-11), verified here by reading. Fixed: pools by side; tines computed at read; the board. | ✅ r15 |
| **LVL.2** | ⬜ **SIDE-BY-KIND vs SIDE-BY-PRICE.** The sweep and TCS plans still test `kind == "resistance"` as a side; the hunt compares prices. After a level is crossed, kind is its *role* and price is its *side* — the TCS relies on that (a high accepted is the level it sells against); the sweep's read is fine while it also compares price. Worth its own row before otv5. | 🔲 OPEN |

### The liquidity hunt (PLAN_SPEC §37)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **HUNT.1** | ⬜ **THE FIRST WEEK IS THE TEST.** Per morning: the bias row, A1/A2, reached-the-level, the grant's fate. `HANDOFF_TTL_TICKS` = 8 is a prior. If the predecessor gets the hunt (otv4 r325), the ORB there needs the rejection mark (bars from a rejection at its level to its exit — the give-back window) so the comparison is fair. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **HUNT.2** | ⬜ **THE GRANT IS WRITTEN AND READ BY NOTHING.** `sig.handoff_grant` is set at `main.py:4095` and that is its ONLY occurrence in the tree — `_execute_condor_leg`'s `make_record` (`main.py:2574-2690`) declares no such field, so the token never reaches `trades.db`. OTV4TEST r12's ledger row states *"the sweep's fill carries the grant it fired on"*; it does not, and that sentence should be read as intent rather than as record. ⚠️ **NOT A WALL, and the first reading of this overstated it.** `execution/handoff.py` logs the whole lifecycle at INFO — issue (`:48`), expiry (`:37`), fire (`:68`), each carrying level, side and tick count — and `bot.log` has no logrotate rule and is untouched by `retention_purge`, so HUNT.1's week IS answerable by a hand-join from `bot.log` timestamps to `trades.db` entry times. Persisting it is one column and turns that join into a read. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **HUNT.3** | ⬜ **THE GRANT PATH SKIPS THE PAIRING GATE — A RULING, NOT YET A DEFECT.** Four call sites of `_execute_condor_leg`: `main.py:3831`, `:4016` and `:5000` each sit behind `_can_open_credit_spread`; `:4097` — `_attempt_sweep_on_grant` — does not. The sweep's OWN bars all still apply, since `generate_signal` runs in full, so the docstring at `main.py:4080` (*"every other bar the sweep has still applies"*) is not wrong about those. What is bypassed is the DISPATCH gate: Rule 1 (max two sides), Rule 3 (never two of a side), Rule 4 (the pairing table) and the inversion geometry check. Whether a grant should yield the slot rule ONLY, or the pairing rules with it, is the operator's call — §37.2 says the grant *"answers the slot question and nothing else"*, which argues the gate should still run. | 🔲 OPEN |

### From the predecessor — what mainline found after the split (PORT_MANIFEST v0.8)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **PRE.1** | 🔴 **THE CONTRACT IS NOT ON THE ROW, SO NO SINGLE-LEG TRADE IS REPLAYABLE.** `EntryEngine._record_kwargs` (`execution/entry_engine.py:616-636`) writes `symbol = INSTRUMENT` — the UNDERLYING — and nothing naming the option. The credit path (`main.py:2683-2685`) has written `option_symbol` all along; this shared factory never has, and both `enter()` and the standing-offer supervisor go through it. **MEASURED ON THIS BOX'S OWN LEDGER, not inferred: 19 of 21 rows in `trades.db` carry `option_symbol = NULL`** — every `ORBStrategy`, every `RunawayContinuation`, and all three `LiquidityHunt` rows; only the two `SweepCreditSpread` rows have one. Nothing on those rows can be joined to `quote_series`, so `exit_replay` and every premium-path study refuse them (mainline measured the same thing as 301 of 337 rows refused). FIXED ON MAINLINE AT r340 — one line, the same factory, the same "ONE LINEAGE" docstring in both repos — and **FORWARD-ONLY**: rows already in the book stay unreplayable, so this stops the wall being hit again rather than undoing it. ⚠️ **HUNT.1's first week opens Monday 2026-09-14**; every hunt fill that week lands unreplayable unless this is in first. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **PRE.2** | ⬜ **TWO MORE PREDECESSOR COMMITS TO ASSESS; ONE CHECKED AND RULED OUT.** Of mainline's **eleven** execution-path commits since the fork point, r340 is PRE.1 and r364 is already absorbed (OTV4TEST r15). Unassessed: **r341** (PLN.1 — the condor slipped r213's net so the panel accuses a dispatch bug that does not exist; touches `strategy/plan.py`, which this fork also carries) and **r344** (RPT.26 — `is_short_position` had no writer, so credit MFE/MAE are swapped in every report reading them; may be mainline-infrastructure only — not yet read). ✅ **r345 CHECKED, DOES NOT APPLY HERE.** On mainline the exit path resolved every credit spread to SELL_TO_CLOSE — a real order in the wrong direction at a live broker. This fork's `_close_vertical` (`execution/exit_engine.py:3093`) hardcodes BUY_TO_CLOSE on the short and SELL_TO_CLOSE on the long and never reads the flag; its only two bare `is_short_position` reads (`:2327` in `_evaluate_adopted`, `:3054` in `_close_single_leg`) are both on the ADOPTED path, where `execution/broker_reconcile.py:139` does write it. The fork's exit engine diverged to v4.17 and the defect is not present. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **PRE.3** | ⬜ **`level_event` HAS NO HOME ON MAINLINE — FOR THE CONTROL AGENT, NOT THIS BOX.** The rejection fact (OTV4TEST r3) created `level_event` and placed it in this repo's `NEVER_PURGE` (`warehouse/retention_purge.py:249`), so it accumulates here forever. It does not exist on mainline **at all** — no table, no `DERIVED_TABLES` entry, no `DERIVED_ARTIFACT_DAYS` row, no coverage policy. Under a supersede IN PLACE the fork's code inherits mainline's infrastructure, and a table in no list is the by-absence exposure mainline has already paid for three times (r86, r191, r270 — *"added with its push, not after it"*). Infrastructure is mainline's to protect; this row exists so the item is HANDED OVER rather than assumed. Same question applies to any other fork-only store at merge time. | 🔲 OPEN |

### Layout (for otv5)

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **LAY.1** | ✅ (r14) **THE ROOT IS FIVE FILES**: `main.py`, `config.py`, `devtools.sh`, `setup_ec2.sh`, `requirements.txt` (+ README). Operator readers → `tools/`; installers, workers and the push/snapshot/configure scripts → `deploy/`. Every caller re-pointed (devtools, eod_bot, the three timer installers, snapshot, push, setup_ec2, check_versions, the file-map entry points, four checkers). `gen_file_map --check`: the same 2 known orphans as before, none new. Three timers' units point at moved paths → `deploy/reinstall_timers.sh`, run once from the menu after the bake. | ✅ r14 |
| **LAY.2** | ⬜ **`deploy/` is now installers AND units AND ops scripts.** Fine for one box; otv5 may want `deploy/units/`, `deploy/install/`, `ops/`. Decide at the port, not here. | 🔲 OPEN |

### Repo hygiene found on the way

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **HYG.5** | ✅ (r9) main.py reads the TCS and sweep windows from their plans (`tcs_plan.window_end()`, `sweep_plan.LATEST_ET`); `check_tcs_parked` P5b green. Was: main.py read `TCS_ENTRY_END_ET` from config, red before the fork touched TCS. | ✅ r9 |

| id | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| **HYG.2** | ⬜ **DOC STRIP — PROPOSED, NOT RULED.** FORK_BRIEF §3.6 proposes removing `ROADMAP.md`, `PORT_STATE.md`, `INHERITED_FINDINGS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `VISION.md` (mainline history with no fork consumer). `BACKLOG.md` was ruled: restarted blank (this file). The rest await the operator; deletion is a revision with a ledger row, and `FILE_MAP.md` is checked for links first. | 🔲 OPEN |
| **HYG.1** | ✅ (r12) `_combine` and `momentum_val` dedented out of `ramp()`; every readiness path had raised NameError behind the import guard. Predecessor defect #8; ports as a fix. | ✅ r12 |
| **HYG.6** | ✅ (r13) **A CHECKER'S FIXTURE BECAME A LIVE POSITION.** `check_standing_offer` S5 adopted `orb-T1` into the box's trades.db during r12's land; the bot resumed and "managed" a phantom CALL 196 until it was voided by hand. Fixed twice: the checker binds a temp logger, and `land.sh` runs every CHECK with `OT_TRADES_DB`/`OT_DERIVED_DB` on scratch files so no checker can reach a live store again. Defect #12 in the manifest — the fixture is identical on mainline; port both halves. | ✅ r13 |
| **HYG.4** | ✅ (r6) **A TEST WROTE INTO THE BOX'S LIVE PLAN LEDGER.** `TestStrat` rows (WIPED_BY_RESTART, TRIGGERED) in the corpus on 2026-09-09, from the lander's checks: `Plan._ledger_open` resolved the registry's live ledger even when a test had bound its own store. Closed: a bound store never reaches the box's ledger. The existing rows are history; delete by hand if they offend. | ✅ r6 |
| **HYG.7** | ✅ (r16) **SWP.0 CARRIED `🔲 OPEN` IN ITS STATE CELL WHILE ITS OWN PROSE READ `✅ (r5)`.** `check_ledger_parity` reads the LAST cell, so the open list read one row longer than it is. Same defect class as mainline r245, where ten of twenty-five rows read OPEN because the state was inferred from a paragraph rather than from the marker. Corrected: the marker IS the state and the prose beside it is commentary. | ✅ r16 |
| **HYG.3** | ⬜ **`tests/check_ledger_parity.py` READS THE FROZEN LEDGER.** It opens `docs/GENESIS.md` (mainline, frozen here) and this backlog; on the fork the revision it should reconcile against is `docs/GENESIS-TEST.md`. Not run by the lander today; repoint before relying on it. | 🔲 OPEN |

---

## PART 2 — CLOSED

| id | item | closed |
|---|---|---|
| **ORB.3** | The runaway carried velocity stall through the shared evaluator. Closed OTV4TEST r3: the runaway's exit list is its own (§30.4) and the stall is off it. | r3 |

---

## PART 3 — CHANGELOG

**v0.16 — 2026-09-12 — OTV4TEST r16 — DOCS ONLY. THE FINDINGS FROM THE THREAD THAT READ THE REPO, PRESERVED BEFORE THEY EVAPORATE.** No code changed; nothing goes near the execution path before Monday's open. Opened: **PRE.1** — the contract is not on the row, measured as 19 of 21 rows in this box's own `trades.db` carrying a NULL `option_symbol`, which makes every ORB, runaway and liquidity-hunt trade unreplayable and is fixed on mainline at r340; **PRE.2** — r341 and r344 still to assess, with r345 checked and ruled out by reading `_close_vertical`; **PRE.3** — `level_event` exists on this fork and nowhere on mainline, handed to the control agent as infrastructure; **HUNT.2** — the handoff grant is written at `main.py:4095` and read nowhere, so r12's "the sweep's fill carries the grant" is intent rather than record, though the lifecycle is in `bot.log` and the week is still answerable; **HUNT.3** — the grant path is the one `_execute_condor_leg` call site with no pairing gate, which is a ruling owed rather than a defect found. Closed: **HYG.7**, the SWP.0 state marker. ⚠️ **THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS NOW STATED** (operator 2026-09-12): this box is where the EXECUTION is perfected, mainline is where the INFRASTRUCTURE stays protected, and the eventual supersede is IN PLACE — so the fork's code inherits mainline's S3, conductor, reports and retention rather than needing its own. FORK_BRIEF §5's "keep nothing, do not build an export job" stands unchanged. **v0.15 — 2026-09-12 — OTV4TEST r15 — the level board and the two defects under it (PLAN_SPEC §38), mainline r364's fix in its own shape. LVL.1 closed; HUNT.1's clock restarts.**

**v0.14 — 2026-09-11 — OTV4TEST r14 — ROOT CLEANUP: five files at the root, readers in tools/, installers and workers in deploy/, requirements.txt, a README that says what the repo is. One-time REINSTALL TIMERS on the box.**

**v0.13 — 2026-09-10 — OTV4TEST r13 — defect #12: a checker's fixture became a live phantom position; the lander now runs every CHECK on scratch stores (HYG.6).**

**v0.12 — 2026-09-10 — OTV4TEST r12 (re-cut, superseding the unlanded anchors archive) — anchors (§36), HYG.1 closed, AND the liquidity hunt with the handoff grant (§37). HUNT.1 opened.**

**v0.10 — 2026-09-09 — OTV4TEST r11 — the condor ladder is two rungs (PLAN_SPEC §35 v2): the roll widens its wing, prepared every tick; the tent and invert retired; the group final-form floor; the whipsaw named; the complement rich or not taken. CND.2 opened.**

**v0.9 — 2026-09-09 — OTV4TEST r10 — the condor management plan (PLAN_SPEC §35); the predecessor defect list in PORT_MANIFEST; CND.1 opened.**

**v0.8 — 2026-09-09 — OTV4TEST r9 — the TCS on the accepted extreme outside the EM (PLAN_SPEC §34); PORT_MANIFEST opened; HYG.5 closed; TCS.1 opened.**

**v0.7 — 2026-09-09 — OTV4TEST r8 — TCS narrates every path (a r238 wiring defect, fixed on sight); NOT ASKED is hushed on the readers; BAKE does daemon-reload.**

**v0.6 — 2026-09-09 — OTV4TEST r7 — readers hush dormant plans; the record stays whole (PLAN_SPEC §33); §32.2b states the butterfly's slot.**

**v0.5 — 2026-09-09 — OTV4TEST r6 — the butterfly on the pin, OI fixed and visible, HYG.4 closed.**
Best-R wing, smoothed persistence as a bar, OI as a starved input; the OI fetch
runs every batch in one loop; Feed health shows the OI lines; a bound test store
never touches the live ledger. BFLY.1–2 and OI.1 opened.

**v0.4 — 2026-09-09 — OTV4TEST r5 — the sweep credit spread on the rejection fact; SWP.1–2 opened.**
Tines are levels (keyed on the tine, the tine rule), no level inside the opening
range, the sweep plan prepares both sides from 09:35 with the short anchored on
the level, fires on a fresh REJECTED, exits hard close → 15% of risk → breach
accepted → nickel; spent on acceptance only. SWP.0's spec is done; its window is
09:35–14:00. Devtools unchanged.

**v0.3 — 2026-09-08 — OTV4TEST r4 — devtools 2.0: the box menu catches up with control.**
The otv1-era break-glass menu is replaced by a registry-rendered menu in
control's shape (numbers assigned at display time; cite by label). Ported to
run LOCALLY: SENSORS (the same SQL over this box's own derived_store.db and
feed_store.db, with an ET date prompt), DEBUG / LOGS, and the R SUITE via the
fork's own tests/*.py through their `--db` escape hatch on trades.db (the box
is masked from S3). New sensors: PLAN ROWS (the per-tick narrative) and LEVEL
EVENTS (the rejection fact). Fleet wrangling is deliberately absent. LAND and
BAKE now sit under GIT & LAND — the numbers moved; the labels did not.

**v0.2 — 2026-09-08 — OTV4TEST r3 — the rejection fact, the runaway spec, RUN.6–8 and SWP.0 opened, ORB.3 closed.**
The level engine emits WICKED / REJECTED / ACCEPTED on closed 1m bars (one close
back inside on a shallow pierce, two on a deep); the runaway is re-specced
(PLAN_SPEC §30): arm on the accepted 50, strength once at acceptance, band from
strength, one per break on any exit with re-validation on actual, no premium
stop, exits handoff → thesis → fizzle → trail → theta → backstop. ORB gains the
handoff exit (§29 amendment). devtools 40 auto-selects a lone archive; 41 bakes.

**v0.1 — 2026-09-08 — OTV4TEST r2 — THE FORK'S BACKLOG STARTS BLANK (v0.x: fork-numbered, never mainline's); ORB.1–3, HYG.1–3 opened.**
Opened alongside the first rewire: the ORB spec and its plan contract agreed
with the operator part by part (PLAN_SPEC §29) and built — `strategy/orb_plan.py`
selects from 09:35, the strategy fires on its bars with the plan's variables,
the stale re-arm and the ATR floor deleted by ruling, velocity stall out of the
ORB exit path, ORB asked every tick and observing silently outside its window.
