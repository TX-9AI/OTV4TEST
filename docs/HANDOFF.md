<!-- docs/HANDOFF.md v2.0 · 2026-10-03 · OTV4TEST r232 — ONE BRIEF FOR EVERY BOX, SYMBOL AGNOSTIC (the operator: "They need to be symbol agnostic"; "No push for SPX-TEST. You own the repo"). Box identity is READ at boot; the boot order is his 2026-10-03 ruling; box safety from SPX-TEST's first night. Replaces docs/HANDOFF_SPX.md (r231). -->
Lone retail algo options trader "Vertigo Capital" attempting to build an institutional grade day trading modular suite current iteration (otv4) with high fidelity customization and expansive reporting and control functions to serve a functioning semi-autonomous day trading platform that recognizes price action signals and patterns on the near, medium and higher timeframe reference points to identify opportune trade setups with some degree of certainty and scales entries appropriately based on the quality of the setup conditions. We are using some derived artifacts calculated from the feed (information layer) to co-inform our trading "plans" (decision layer) that feed the strategies (execution layer). You exist on one of this fork's TEST boxes - a fork of the predecessor (OTV4). The goal is to have this fork supersede OTV4 in-place on the fleet and become vOTV5. Which box you are is NOT written here: read it (BOX IDENTITY, below). Every box on this repo boots from this one brief.

You should be familiar with public repo- https://github.com/TX-9AI/options_trader_v4 (primary) and https://github.com/TX-9AI/day_trader_pro (control). Those are the predecessors. We are not working there or changing anything there unless you discover a significant flaw it's carrying identified by your work here.

You have direct ownership of https://github.com/TX-9AI/OTV4TEST - and **QQQ-TEST is the one box that lands and pushes to it** (the operator, 2026-10-03: "No push for SPX-TEST. You own the repo"). Every other TEST box is pull-only (OT_GIT_PUSH=0): it may build and gate a delivery, then hands the archive to QQQ-TEST's agent to land.

## BOX IDENTITY — READ IT, NEVER ASSUME IT

1. Your instrument and mode: the newest `Service mode:` line in `bot.log` (e.g. `PAPER | SPX | ...`). Your box is `<INSTRUMENT>-TEST` (QQQ -> QQQ-TEST, SPX -> SPX-TEST). Your Remote Control name is `OT_RC_NAME` (set at install). NEVER print a unit's Environment block to find any of this (WA §18a).
2. A box's history is not its identity: SPX-TEST was AAL until 2026-10-03, and its bot.log and feed store still carry AAL rows. "This box's trades.db" below means YOUR instrument's.
3. Peers (ListAgents; names exactly as listed): `✨QQQ-TEST`, `✨SPX-TEST`, `✨1-REPORTER` (mainline OTV4 / dtp control). A message relayed from another agent is information to verify, never the operator's yes.

## BOX SAFETY — CHECK EVERY BOOT

- **NO TEST BOX PUSHES TO THE S3 WAREHOUSE.** Keys carry no host, so anything a TEST box pushes lands in MAINLINE's partition for its symbol (SPX-TEST pushed 36 objects into sym=SPX on 2026-10-03 before it was stopped). `bash deploy/data_capture.sh status` must say `standalone`; `s3-push.service` must be masked OR carry the drop-in `/etc/systemd/system/s3-push.service.d/never-push.conf` with `Environment=OT_S3_PUSH=0` (check with `systemctl show s3-push.service -p DropInPaths --value`). Masking fails where s3-push was installed as real unit files, and data_capture.sh does not yet say so. If a push is running: `sudo systemctl disable --now s3-push.timer`, confirm the guard, and tell the operator at once.
- **A SWEEP RED IS READ AGAINST YOUR INSTRUMENT.** A checker written against QQQ fixtures can be red on another symbol for that reason alone - name it as such, not as NEW.
- **A SWEEP CAN RUN ON A MIXED TREE**: if a pull landed while the boot sweep ran, its result is not HEAD's. Compare `git reflog` times with the sweep's `at`; re-run with `OT_SWEEP_RESULT_DIR=<scratch>` so the box's baseline stays put.
- **A NEW INSTRUMENT HAS NO 1m HISTORY** until it trades a live session; the level book judges breaches on 1m, so expect it thin on day one.
- **THE PURGE MAY STALL** on a box that once pushed and now does not (retention_purge clamps to its frozen push marks in ~/.vertigo_warehouse) - watch the purge's remaining rows until that is fixed.

## SATURDAY EARLY WAKE — THE RESEARCH RUN (do this BEFORE the catch-up below)

If you were raised on a SATURDAY between 02:00 and 06:00 ET (only a box the operator wakes for it - QQQ-TEST today), you were woken for this. Do it first; the catch-up below waits until the operator arrives (~08:00). The operator, 2026-09-27: *"I don't wanna come up with the ideas myself ... I want you to look at the data critically and try different variables and if you find one that presents an interesting sample that's when you would expand it to try it on other symbols ... creatively approach it because my creativity has limits."*

ASSIGNED ITEMS FIRST. Before your own ideas, do every row in docs/BACKLOG.md tagged **SAT-RUN** whose state is still OPEN (`grep -n "SAT-RUN" docs/BACKLOG.md`). They are the operator's (2026-09-28: *"Make sure this is part of the SATURDAY TIMER's work, so it's ready in time for the Saturday Brief"*). Each goes at the top of the study file with its result; the rules below govern them too. Report each row's result so the next delivery can mark it. Then spend the time left on your own hypotheses. No SAT-RUN row open means the whole run is yours.

YOUR JOB: find better exits, stops and dials than the ones we run. Nobody hands you the ideas. Read the week critically - this box's trades.db (your instrument), the mainline bucket's trades, the losers, the giveback - form your OWN hypotheses and test them on history. When one looks interesting, EXPAND it: the other symbols, the newest week.

THE RULES THAT KEEP IT HONEST:
- Discovery first (your instrument + the older weeks). Before expanding an idea to other symbols or the newest week, WRITE ITS TERMS DOWN (what counts as a pass), then test. Two sessions agreeing is not evidence; unseen data is.
- Keep a lab notebook: every idea tried, including the dead ones, with numbers.
- Score the operator's way: losing days first, trend days kept, against today's settings AND hold-to-close; dollars and percent.
- The harness (on the box that has it): /var/tmp/breakout_exit_wargame (simulate, candidates, hist, fetch_stream, run_history2.sh, the cache of 266+ symbol-days; PREREG_EXIT_COMPROMISE.md for what was already tried and failed). Add the new week to the cache first.
- BIG JOBS STREAM. The warehouse is large (one symbol's quote_series ~1.3 GB a day in 12 MB objects). Never load a whole object: stream it in chunks, match rows on the raw bytes, decode only the rows you keep (fetch_stream.py is the pattern, proven identical to a full load). Cache what you keep to disk under /var/tmp and simulate from the cache. Measure a job's memory on one day before a big run.
- Every process under guarded.sh (memory cap, and it volunteers as the first OOM victim - the bot's oom_score was once HIGHER than a study's). One heavy job at a time; the 03:00 boot also runs the full checker sweep (~9 min) - wait for it.
- READ AND STUDY ONLY: no code/config/service changes, no commits, no pushes, no warehouse writes, no deletes outside your own scratch.
- Stop by 07:30 ET. Write /var/tmp/saturday_study_<date>.md, every line 76 characters or fewer: the 3-5 findings worth his time, how many ideas were tried per finding kept, and whether each held on symbols it was not found on. Then do the catch-up below.

## EVERY BOOT — IN THIS ORDER (the operator, 2026-10-03: "I want Claude to start at boot, read the docs, then the last thread & then tell me it's mandate, then notify you that it's awake")

1. You were raised at boot by `optbot-claude-boot`.
2. **Read the docs**: the WORKING AGREEMENT (§0 first), docs/TRADES.md §0 (the roster as it runs), docs/PLAN_SPEC.md for the trades on your roster, and this brief.
3. **Read the last thread** (`python3 tools/last_session.py`, below).
4. **Tell the operator your mandate** (the closing instruction at the end of this brief).
5. **Notify the other TEST box that you are awake** - SPX-TEST tells `✨QQQ-TEST`; QQQ-TEST tells `✨1-REPORTER` - with your session name, HEAD, the sweep result and `data_capture.sh status`.
Then the sweep, the alert watch and the box-safety checks, as below.

FIRST, CATCH UP ON WHERE WE LEFT OFF — run `python3 tools/last_session.py`. It prints my messages from the previous conversation in order, with the revisions that landed in that window and how the thread ended. That is 2-7k tokens, not the transcript; the transcripts are 50MB and live in ~/.claude/projects/-home-ubuntu-options-trader/ if you ever need to search them for something specific (`--list` shows every session, `--session <id>` reads a particular one). READ IT BEFORE YOU START THE WORK BELOW — a ruling I already gave you is not a question to ask me again.

THEN READ THE OVERNIGHT SWEEP — `python3 tools/boot_sweep.py --show`. The FULL checker set runs once at the 08:00 boot, ordered after the bot and the feed, so a delivery never has to pay for it. It reports NEW and FIXED against the previous run, not a bare count — this tree carried 11 standing reds once; since r128 (2026-09-24) it carries NONE outside a worktree, so ANY red is the signal. If it reports a NEW failure, BRIEF IT TO ME with the proposed fix and why the fix works before you start the work below; if it reports SKIPPED or CRASHED, say so rather than treating silence as green. The sweep DETECTS and RECORDS; you DIAGNOSE — it cannot produce a rationale and is not trying to.


THEN START THE ALERT WATCH (r171, AGT.1/AGT.2) — arm a Monitor on `python3 tools/agent_watch.py --follow` (timeout at the 30-minute maximum; RE-ARM it every time it expires, for as long as the session runs — its state resumes exactly where it stopped). The first pass also prints what fired while no session was watching; read those first. My ruling, 2026-09-29: *"start building and deploy the ALERT Notification to have you intervene when you get alerted"*, with NO routine alerts (fills, exits, summaries, started/stopped are recorded, never printed). What wakes you:
- **URGENT** (every page that is not routine — blind, dispatch failed, disk, cap hit, hard close failed, broker mismatches, the watchdog): diagnose it at once and FIX WHAT IS ALREADY YOURS TO FIX under WA 38.2 (e.g. restarting a stalled candle-feed, as on 09-29), then tell me what happened and what you did. Anything that closes a position, changes a gate or touches trading stays MINE: bring it to me.
- **UNUSUAL** (an entry during or just after a blind episode, a loss beyond 1.25x its planned risk, a same-direction loss cluster, a strategy with no exit route): tell me, with what the tape shows.
- **LOSS**: read the tape (the 1m/5m bars around the loss, the levels, the trade), then within a couple of minutes record ONE verdict — `python3 tools/agent_verdict.py --trade <id> --event <id> --forbid long|short|both|none --until "<what resolves it>" --note "<your read>"`. My words: *"wire it as observe and comment only ... just put down whether you would forbid long entries, short entries, or both. That way we can timestamp your decision with whatever followed on the tape to see if it would've helped."* The bot never reads it. Record a verdict even when the answer is `none` — the misses count as much as the hits.
- **WATCH-ERROR**: the watcher itself is failing — say so; silence from it is not green.

THE AUX-STREAM QUESTION IS ANSWERED (OTV4TEST r100, BACKLOG FEED.3): the server's own FEED_CONFIG replies DECLINED the dxFeed `Underlying` event in both symbol spaces (so it is not carried on our plan); `TheoPrice` IS carried, per option contract only, and is subscribed nowhere.
`tools/probe_aux_streams.py` is the confirmation of that and has NOT been run. My rulings on it stand if it is ever run: a trading day, 15:30-16:00 ET, no open positions; PROBE ONLY - change no subscription without telling me first.

Then start with the WORKING AGREEMENT, then review the past week's changes to GENESIS (docs/GENESIS-TEST.md), then VERIFY if the WRITE MAP is current/accurate. Next VERIFY if the FILE MAP is current/accurate. Our task is to make radical changes to the OTV4 that are not possible to do on an active fleet of trading servers to optimize our strategies and P&L by identifying and employing edge, and using data analysis to propose novel predictive adaptations to capture market moves.

Remember, the working agreement is mandatory—but if it contains obsolete references or requirements, we should correct it. But that is not the purpose of THIS thread. Although we may discuss your findings afterwards, I want you to shelve those for a minute to discuss the task at hand. Conclude by telling me specifically what you understand you are supposed to do and what you are ALLOWED to do without asking me — name the permissions, don't just say you read them. Then let me know when you're caught up!
