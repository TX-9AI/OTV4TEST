# PORT_MANIFEST.md — OTV4TEST → options_trader_v4 — v0.2
v0.2  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r10 — the r10 rows and the DEFECTS FOUND IN THE PREDECESSOR
      section (eleven, one still open) — port these whether or not the rulings port.
v0.1  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r9 — opened. One line per file per revision, with the
      ruling it carries, so the back-port is a checklist and not archaeology.
      The predecessor is FROZEN at e955020 (r322) — checked 2026-09-09, zero
      commits since the fork — so the port is the fork's revisions applied
      forward in ledger order, not a three-way merge. Tests are half the port:
      every checker re-pointed here needs the same re-pointing on mainline.

## DEFECTS FOUND IN THE PREDECESSOR (port these whether or not the rulings port)

| # | defect | where | fixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TCS wrote no plan row on its common path — bare returns with the tick open; NOT ASKED all afternoon, every credit window (r238) | strategy/trend_credit_spread.py | r8 |
| 2 | TCS `POP ≥ 0.70` was a config constant nothing read | strategy/trend_credit_spread.py | r9 (applied in tcs_plan) |
| 3 | OI fetch lost the first batch of every cycle — "Event loop is closed", one `asyncio.run` per batch | data/open_interest.py | r6 |
| 4 | ORB invalidated on a WICK to the 50 while the runaway armed on a close+hold — the band owned by nobody | analysis/orb_engine.py | r3 |
| 5 | `finish_break` only on a LOSING runaway exit — a trail winner re-entered on the same standing state | database/trade_logger.py | r3 |
| 6 | the lander's checks wrote `TestStrat` rows into the box's live plan_ledger (`_ledger_open` ignored a bound store) | strategy/plan.py | r6 |
| 7 | main.py read the sweep's window from a module string ("14:00") and the TCS's from config — the remainder honoured a stale window | main.py | r9 |
| 8 | `analysis/trade_readiness.py::_combine` defined nested, called at module level — NameError on every readiness path, masked by an import guard | analysis/trade_readiness.py | **OPEN** (HYG.1) |
| 9 | `check_tcs_parked` P5b red before the fork touched TCS; outside the lander's set | tests/ | r9 |
| 10 | the level engine never read a high or a low — a rejection was invisible to the derived layer | derived/levels.py | r3 (built) |
| 11 | the condor management plan only recognised legs already flagged `is_condor_leg` — a lone sweep/TCS vertical read as "no credit verticals open" | strategy/iron_condor_strategy.py | r10 |
