execution/exit_engine.py  v4.15
v4.15 2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r10 — the tent floor's reason names its basis: 15% from
      the structure AS FORMED (condor_roll v4.7 sets `entry_premium` to the
      as-formed cost and keeps `cumulative_credit` alongside). Operator: "15%
      of wherever our credit is from that point, not including the previous
      rolls and other transactions."
v4.14 2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r9 — THE TCS 15%-OF-CREDIT STOP IS LONE-ONLY: a hedged
      leg's sibling suppresses it (operator 2026-09-09), the same mechanism the
      sweep leg uses. Order for the TCS: hard close → 15% (lone) → the level
      lost (`tcs_breach`, a close back through the accepted extreme the spread
      was sold against — `underlying_stop` carries it). ⚠️ NO NICKEL CLOSE
      STANDS: the 2026-08-14 ruling ("no closing it short of a breach or the
      hard close") was MEASURED — EV held to expiry — and today's untangle
      listed a nickel in passing without revisiting that measurement. Left as
      ruled; flagged in the r9 report for an explicit decision.
v4.13 2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r5 — THE SWEEP VERTICAL'S STRUCTURAL EXIT. Operator:
      *"we exit quickly if the breach is accepted, otherwise hold to flatten
      or if it runs hard, we take the nickel close."* In `_evaluate_condor_leg`
      a SWEEP vertical (setup_type sweep_credit_spread) now exits on BREACH
      ACCEPTED — ACCEPT_CLOSES (2) consecutive closed 1m bars beyond the pool
      it sold against (`pool_price` on the record) — placed AFTER the
      15%-of-risk lone stop (operator: two minutes into a dead thesis can
      rack up serious losses; the floor answers first, the breach names the
      reason) and before the nickel close (0.05, CONDOR_NICKEL_CLOSE), which
      was already there. The level is marked SPENT on THIS exit only
      (trade_logger v4.13), not on a stop-out: a 15% wobble leaves a held
      level live. Hedged (condor) legs keep their stop suppression unchanged.
v4.12 2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r3 — THE HANDOFF, THE THESIS, THE FIZZLE, THE BACKSTOP.
      Operator 2026-09-08. In `_evaluate_orb`, for BOTH families:
      · REJECTED HANDOFF (position 2, after the hard close, before any floor):
        `DerivedStore.latest_rejection()` reports a pool on the trade's side,
        beyond the entry, REJECTED on a close since entry → exit "handoff:
        pool X rejected on close — sweep owns it". The reversal is where the
        ORB historically gave its gains back; the fact is emitted once, in
        derived/levels v4.1, and read here rather than re-detected.
      For RUNAWAY records only:
      · NO PREMIUM STOP. *"If we're going to immediately open another momentum
        trade the second the preceding one stops out, then why not just
        HOLD?"* The exit is the negation of the entry: THESIS DEAD = a 1m
        CLOSE back through the 50% level (boundary ± width/2 from the record's
        own range). While price holds beyond it, premium wobbles do not exit.
        What a 20% floor WOULD have done is recorded on the decision
        (`would_have_floored`) so the first sessions show whether a percent
        under the structure is needed — a question, not a bar.
      · FIZZLE — the entry's evidence decaying, measured on the bars since
        entry: EVENTS (no threshold) higher-low broken, VWAP recrossed (when
        the frame carries volume); DIALS (self-referenced) acceptance decaying
        (trend_strength acc_delta < 0 with acc_recent < 0.5), range
        contracting (< 0.5x the first bars), premium diverging (a new
        underlying high in the last 3 bars without a new premium high). Exit
        on two events, or one event plus one dial. Priors, recorded per tick.
      · STRUCTURE BACKSTOP — a 1m close back through the ORB boundary itself
        (beneath the 50; the air-pocket case). Replaces the 20% floor.
      Order for the runaway: hard close → handoff → thesis dead → fizzle →
      trail (unchanged) → theta bleed (kept) → backstop.
      ORB records keep their own list (§29) plus the handoff.
v4.11 2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r2 — VELOCITY STALL IS OUT OF THE ORB PATH. Operator,
      2026-09-08, on the seven ORB exits read back to him: *"Keep all but 5.
      Theta bleed should catch whatever a stall would have stood in for."*
      `_evaluate_orb` skips `_velocity_stall` for `ORBStrategy` records. The
      RunawayContinuation shares this evaluator and is NOT changed here — the
      runaway's exits are its own conversation, and this fork takes one trade
      at a time. Pinned by check_orb_plan P13 with the stall forced to fire.
v4.10 2026-09-05  r269 — 🔴 THE FORMED CONDOR'S LOSS BOUNDARY IS SETTLED: there
      is NONE, deliberately. Operator: *"The current architecture covers all
      condor management. It's a settled issue."* The 15:45 close, the nickel
      close and the roll ARE the management. This replaces a citation to
      `docs/HANDOFF_CONDOR_STOP_20260824.md`, deleted this revision — that
      document held the only statement of the open question, so the answer is
      recorded AT THE SITE that would otherwise invent a boundary. No code
      change.
v4.9  2026-09-04  r238 — 🔴 THE TREND-CREDIT BRANCH GAINS A
      15%-OF-CREDIT STOP, and it runs FIRST. Before this the branch checked the
      boundary breach and returned, so a trend credit had no premium stop at
      all. Operator, 2026-09-04: the 15% *"is doing the heavy lifting, flatten
      is last resort, nickel closes on a nice move."* NOT the lone stop's 15%
      OF RISK — 4x different, and chosen. On a $2.50 credit it is $0.375
      against a $2.45 win to the nickel: a realized 6.5:1, breakeven near 13%.
      `stop_survivable` at ENTRY is what stops it being the r155-inverted stop
      that fires on noise, so the entry gate is load-bearing for this exit.
v4.8  2026-08-27  r169: the butterfly's TARGET (20% of max profit) and MAX
      HOLD (150 min) are retired — operator: "1545 flatten or 25% loss,
      whichever comes first." Its exits are exactly two now, like the
      credits: the 25% floor and the 15:45 hard close.
v4.7  2026-08-27  r167: BOS EXIT RETIRED from the decision path (operator:
      "overall a loser"; measured 34% / 217 / -$7,085). The only live site was
      step 4 of _evaluate_sweep, the default route for every non-ORB debit.
      Everything else — the 50% trail, the post-target tightening off the
      peak, theta bleed, velocity stall — STAYS, and for the non-ORB
      strategies is now reached through strategy/management.py's decide(),
      which owns the decision and writes the row; this engine remains the
      calculator and the executor. ORB is untouched end to end.
v4.6  2026-08-24  r105 THE EXIT LADDER, per TRADES.md §6. Structural and
      profit-side closes WALK (25% in from best, one increment toward mark,
      ratcheted, never worse than mark); the 15% FLOOR goes straight to MARK and
      re-prices there (a thesis-invalidated stop is not a negotiation); the
      CREDIT hard close takes the nickel or takes ASSIGNMENT and never crosses,
      reversing hard_close_order_mode for credits only; DEBITS keep the cross
      because a long that does not close expires worthless rather than assigning.
      A refused rung advances; a booked fill clears the walk. Quote comes from
      position_manager's per-tick structure stash — the exit path had only ever
      been handed a mark.
v4.5  2026-08-24  (title corrected — the body carried r90's v4.5 content while
      the header still read v4.4)
v4.4  2026-08-24  CONDOR STOP SUPPRESSION (operator ruling: "The 25% stop
      should only apply to a lone vertical spread — never the condor").
      _evaluate_condor_leg: the per-leg premium stop and ratchet now run ONLY
      when no complement is open; while the condor is formed they are
      SUPPRESSED and RE-ARM the moment the leg is alone again (one-way
      suppression = naked full-sized position). Suppress/re-arm persist as
      NEW row fields stop_suppressed_ts / stop_suppressed_by (trade_logger
      v4.3) — stop_premium stays the immutable entry-time floor per the v3.1
      trail lesson — and are announced edge-triggered at INFO. Lone
      calibration unchanged at 15% (TRADES.md §5 / F6). The formed structure
      keeps 15:45 close, nickel close, and the roll. 🔴 SETTLED 2026-09-05
      (r269): THE FORMED CONDOR HAS NO FURTHER LOSS BOUNDARY, DELIBERATELY -
      operator, "the current architecture covers all condor management."
      Those three ARE the management. Stale CONDOR_STOP_LOSS_PCT import removed (unused here
      now; main.py still stamps the row floor with it). exit_reason gains
      "(lone 15%)".

v4.3  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).


v4.2  2026-08-21  PHASE B (r58): still_trending label arms deleted — dead by
      construction since the split; the trend vote alone decides, per the
      block's own doctrine.
      the condor-leg adverse exit DELETED - both tested trending LABELS v4
      never assigns, so neither had run once since the port. Two more exits
      that were dead for a quieter reason than F0.
Exit decisions: trails, structure stops, theta bleed, time.

v4.1  2026-08-20  AUDIT F0/F6/F7/F10. F0: the class was BISECTED - r38 landed
      _track_excursion at column 0 inside the class region, so evaluate and
      all 33 evaluators were nested locals of a telemetry function and EVERY
      intraday exit was dead code (AttributeError into the loop catch-all,
      every tick, every open position). Relocated below the class; the
      doctrine block above it carries the full mechanism. F6: the condor leg
      stop derives from hedge state - 15% unhedged / 25% hedged (TRADES.md 5,
      condor_stop 16 trades 19% win -$1,156 calibrated for a complete
      structure). F7: *_bars columns received 15s TICK counts; now poll-
      derived minutes - still COUNTED not timed, only the unit is honest.
      F10: RunawayContinuation routed to the ORB exit family its spec cites;
      the else-branch names its default out loud instead of absorbing
      strategies silently.
v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/exit_engine.py — AUDIT F7: the BREAKOUT_VOLATILE exemption was scoped to
        `_breakout` records only, so a standalone/handoff continuation that
        ACCELERATED into a breakout IN ITS OWN DIRECTION was closed as a
        Now ANY continuation survives, gated on the TREND VOTE agreeing -
        which is what v4.19's own comment already said should decide, and
        which the label cannot supply because BREAKOUT_VOLATILE has no
        direction. A long no longer survives a violent move DOWN.
v4.21 — Strategy-aware exit logic for all options positions.
🔴 AUDIT F1+F2+F4: THE v4.20 FIX NEVER BOUND, AND THE
        DISPATCH NEVER ROUTED. Two defects of the exact species v4.20 fixed,
        one hop away each, found by the adversarial audit and REPRODUCED AT
        RUNTIME (every failure below executed against 3d9e82e, not inferred):
        (F1) `is_trend_participation` was called at the top of
        `_evaluate_condor_leg` and NEVER IMPORTED into this module — NameError
        on every condor-leg tick and every legacy TC.6 row. The exception
        escapes _manage_one into the tick loop's error counter: 30 errors at
        15s ticks = sys.exit(1) about 7.5 min after any condor leg opens, then
        a systemd crash-loop until the 15:45 branch (which sits ABOVE the
        call) flattens it. The chain test asserted the STRING existed in this
        file — a mention, not a binding (WORKING_AGREEMENT section 20, at the
        import level). Import added, module level.
        (F2) `_execute_condor_leg` now writes strategy="TrendCreditSpread"
        (main v6.8) but evaluate() only routed "IronCondorStrategy" to the
        condor evaluator — every NEW TC.6 record fell to `_evaluate_sweep`,
        the DEBIT evaluator: KeyError 'trail_activation' on the first tick of
        a fresh record; after the crash-restart, target_premium=$0.05 (the
        nickel) read as a debit TP satisfied from tick one, so the position
        lived in the ORB post-target trail with SIGN-INVERTED P&L labels and
        lost the VERTICAL_HOLD_TO_ET exemption; TypeError once value decayed
        below the nickel. The dispatch now routes any record structure.py
        recognises as a credit vertical — both strategy names, legacy rows,
        and the rolled broken wing — to `_evaluate_condor_leg`.
        (F4, HISTORICAL — the condor ratchet was deleted in v4.5) the
        every bake reset an earned breakeven/+20% lock to the base -25% and
        re-opened the round-trip v4.1 exists to close. The earned level now
        rides the SAME persistence the directional trails use: emitted via
        decision.new_trail_stop (position_manager writes the trail_stop
        column) on the STANDALONE branch only — v4.17's formed branch
        deliberately neither applies nor updates it — and re-seeded from the
        column on restart. Only a value below base_stop can be a real condor
        ratchet; anything else is stale/foreign and ignored.
        Ships with tests/test_exit_dispatch_runtime.py — the first suite on
        this path that EXECUTES evaluate() with real record shapes (fresh AND
        rehydrated) instead of grepping source. Verified to fail against
        3d9e82e before this fix.
🔴 THE TC.6 BRANCH DIED ON RESTART. `is_trend_credit` IS
        NOT A COLUMN in the trades table — it lives only in the in-memory
        record. `get_open_trades_live()` does SELECT *, so **any restart
        rehydrated an open trend-participation position WITHOUT the flag**, this
        branch stopped firing, and the leg dropped into the condor ladder with
        the ratchet and the 25% premium stop. Same bug as the 08-14 identity fix,
        one level down: fixed for the process that OPENED the trade, still broken
        for any process that INHERITS it — and the hop that dropped it is a
        systemctl restart, which happens on every bake.
        Now DERIVED from `strategy` / `setup_type`, which are REAL COLUMNS and
        already round-trip. No new column, no migration — a column would fix
        tomorrow and not today, because rows opened before it would still
        rehydrate as None and read as False. The old flag is still honoured when
        present; only its ABSENCE stopped meaning "not a trend credit".
        See strategy/structure.py.
🔴 CNT.1 SHIPPED HALF A FEATURE AND THIS IS THE OTHER HALF.
        The entry branch (continuation_strategy, CNT.1, 2026-08-07) lets
        continuation OPEN on BREAKOUT_VOLATILE, taking direction from the trend
        vote and gating on ADX. `still_trending` here only ever accepted
        TRENDING_BULL / TRENDING_BEAR. So every `trend_continuation_breakout`
        trade was **BORN ALREADY FAILING ITS OWN EXIT TEST** — opened on tick N,
        closed on tick N+1 by reading the SAME UNCHANGED LABEL. THE LABEL NEVER
        Measured live 2026-08-14: 15-second holds, exactly one tick, repeating
        while the setup held. P&L symmetric noise — one tick of random walk minus
        the spread. **This has been true for every breakout continuation since
        2026-08-07.** Sits BEFORE bos_exit, so nothing else got a look.
🔴 LIVE FIX: THE TC.6 BRANCH HAD NO TERMINAL RETURN.
        When NEITHER breach NOR nickel fired it fell straight through to the
        ratchet and the 25% condor stop. `_execute_condor_leg` writes
        stop_premium = credit x 1.25 at entry, so a $0.06 credit put the stop at
        $0.07 — ONE CENT of widening closed the trade. Every TC.6 leg on the
        fleet stopped out within seconds of opening on 2026-08-14.
        THE MEASURED EV WAS HELD TO EXPIRY, UNMANAGED. A premium stop is a
        different trade, which is the entire reason the branch exists.
        ⚠️ THE TEST THAT MISSED IT asserted the branch CONTAINED two
        `return decision` statements. It did. Neither covered the path where
        neither condition fires — the path that was broken. **Counting returns
        proves nothing about the path that has none.** Now asserted on the
        branch's LAST STATEMENT via AST, and verified to FAIL against the
        shipped version.
THE RATCHET WAS CLOSING UNTESTED CONDOR LEGS. Operator:
        "the ratchet is inappropriate for this trade if the condor is fully
        formed. It should only be in effect if there's one side open" and
        "don't close a leg if it hasn't been tested - that's what the roll is
        for."
        MECHANISM: the base -25% stop only ever fires on the TESTED side,
        because a credit spread's value RISES as price approaches your short.
        The RATCHET does the opposite — it tightens the UNTESTED side's stop to
        breakeven at +20% and +20%-locked at +40% PRECISELY BECAUSE that side is
        winning. On the reversal the tested leg stops at -25% and the untested
        leg hits its ratcheted stop too. **A leg price never went near, closed
        by a stop that exists only because it was profitable.** That is the
        double-stop — 5 of 14 condor symbol-days had BOTH sides stopped — and it
        fires BEFORE the roll can be used, because the roll needs a tested side.
        FIX: while `_condor_sibling_open()` is true, the base floor is the ONLY
        stop; no tier, and the stored high-water is neither applied nor updated,
        so a leg returning to standalone resumes from a level it genuinely
        earned. Same interlock the take-profit already used, and it FAILS CLOSED
        (True on error) — treating a leg as part of a structure is the safe
        error.
        direction-aware — a call spread exits only on TRENDING_BULL, which IS
        price rising toward that short strike — so it already fires only on the
        threatened side and is a tested-side exit.
        PRESERVED: `condor_stop` went 0% -> 19% win after the ratchet shipped,
        but that evidence came mostly from STANDALONES (18 of 46 legs never got
        a second side). Scoping keeps the gain where it was measured.
        ⚠️ ACCEPTED COST: an untested leg that runs to +40% and reverses now
        gives it back rather than locking +20%.
VEL.1: THE VELOCITY STALL, ladder step 2c. THE THIRD
        QUESTION, and until now nobody asked it. `orb_structure_stop` asks "did
        the thesis break?"; `_theta_bleed` asks "is my GAIN about to evaporate?"
        — its gate 1 is a gain floor, so a LOSING position is invisible to it.
        **A losing position that has STOPPED MOVING answers no to both** and
        falls to the -40% percentage floor, which is the ABSENCE of a mechanism
        rather than one. 2026-08-12 QQQ: 50 minutes and -42.2% with the
        underlying sitting BELOW the short entry the entire hold — directionally
        right, bleeding anyway, and nothing watching.
        STATISTIC — and it needs NO TARGET, which is why it generalises to every
        long-premium strategy: bev = |theta| / (|delta| * 1440) is the pts/min
        at which delta gains exactly offset decay; ratio = delivered / bev, and
        1.0 IS THE FLAT LINE.
        MEASURED, 15 sessions / 145 ORB trades against the chain archive
        (tests/velocity_feasibility.py — the FIRST tool to ever read it), among
        trades STILL OPEN at each mark:
              mark   winners p10   losers p50   losers p90
               5m       -21.1        -37.3         91.3   <- NO SEPARATION
              10m         3.9         -6.7         20.5
              15m        18.0          0.3         26.7
              20m        29.8          0.9         18.5   <- barely overlap
        The median surviving LOSER treads water at ~1.0 — exactly breakeven —
        while the bottom decile of WINNERS runs at 30x it.
        ⚠️ ORDER IS DELIBERATE: theta_bleed evaluates FIRST so a trade up 10-20%
        and stalled exits GREEN via that path. INDEPENDENT gates, never a
        combined score — the QQQ failure was two mechanisms each correctly
        saying "not my problem" with nothing aggregating that into "then NOBODY
        is watching."
        ⚠️ GRACE IS FORCED BY DATA: winners p10 at 5 min is -21.1, so the bottom
        decile of eventual WINNERS was moving AWAY. No check before 10 minutes.
        ⚠️ SHIPS OBSERVE-ONLY (OT_VELOCITY_ENFORCE=0). Floors rest on n=22 at the
        20-minute mark and are ORB-derived; other strategies are logged, never
        cut, whatever ENFORCE says.
        ⚠️⚠️ EVALUATION DATE: **FRI 2026-08-14**, and it carries a DELETE
        CRITERION — **zero firings across 08-13 and 08-14 means REMOVE THIS
        CODE.** A mechanism that never triggers is not cautious; it is dead code
        that still has to be read, tested and maintained. Standing rule agreed
        with the operator 2026-08-12 after three observers shipped in two days
        with no dates: an observer ships with an evaluation date and a delete
        criterion, or it does not ship. The cautionary case is the chain archive
        — written 07-23, first read 08-12, twenty days later.
        ⚠️ THE ENTRY-FILTER FORM OF THIS IDEA WAS MEASURED AND REJECTED:
        feasibility ratio at entry ran HIGHER for losers than winners at every
        percentile (losers p50 5.05 vs winners 3.87, n=145) — a wide range gives
        a distant target AND a big required move, so feasibility and difficulty
        are the same axis pointing opposite ways. Recorded so it is not rebuilt.
BOS PROTECTED LEVEL GETS A MINIMUM DISTANCE. The level is
        seeded from the LOW of the first bar closing above entry. On a pullback
        entry that bar is the smallest, earliest part of the resumption, so its
        low sits a hair under entry — the level lands INSIDE the symbol's own
        noise band and the next ordinary wiggle fires it.
        OBSERVED LIVE, not inferred: JPM in $1.26 12:49 -> out **$0.00** 12:50
        -> back in $1.26 the same minute. A null round trip — the exit condition
        was already true at entry. QQQ the same session fragmented ONE move into
        four scratches (+$30/+$45.50/+$35/+$7), same strike, three minutes, each
        exit immediately followed by re-entry because the setup was still valid.
        The re-entry loop is a SYMPTOM: it cannot happen unless the position
        closes, so a cooldown would suppress the symptom and leave the premature
        exit intact.
        Fix: floor the level at BOS_MIN_DIST_ATR * ATR from entry, ATR-scaled so
        it widens on NVDA and tightens on GLD automatically. Applied ONLY on the
        continuation path, which seeds with `underlying_entry`.
        ⚠️ min_dist=0 IS BYTE-IDENTICAL to pre-v4.15, ratchet included — a test
        pins that, because otherwise the kill switch is not a kill switch and
        there is no A/B control.
        ⚠️ `low - min_dist` IS NOT MONOTONE: a widening ATR can produce a new
        candidate BELOW the old level, silently slackening the stop exactly when
        volatility rises. Longs max(), shorts min().
        ⚠️ PRE-EXISTING DEFECT FOUND AND DELIBERATELY NOT PATCHED HERE: the
        generic/ORB caller (~966) seeds the tracker with `entry_prem` — the
        OPTION premium — while BOSTracker compares against df_1m UNDERLYING
        closes. A ~$1.26 premium against ~$352 closes means the first bar always
        beats peak_close, so that path seeds a level on bar one regardless of
        structure. Recorded rather than silently fixed; an ATR distance in
        premium units would be meaningless anyway.
CNT.2 INSURANCE GATE (2c), continuation only. BOS (2b) is
        the thesis invalidator and is deliberately ungated on P&L, but
        `BOSTracker.protected_level` is None until the trade makes a new closing
        high past entry — so BOS is structurally BLIND on a trade that goes
        wrong from the first tick, and that is exactly the population running to
        the floor at −29% with MFE +1% (45 trades, 11 sessions). 2c arms the
        already-stamped `underlying_stop` ONLY while `protected_level is None`
        and disarms the instant BOS has a level, so the handoff is exact and
        needs no time window. Structural, not premium-percent: a tighter premium
        floor was measured to net ~zero because it cuts winners that merely dip.
        Exits tag `insurance_stop` so the rollup scores it apart from
        max_loss_floor and bos_exit. `_bos` construction moved OUT of the df_1m
        guard so 2c cannot reference an unbound name. OT_CONT_INSURANCE=0 to
        disable. The level has never been read by anything that trades — treat
        it as an untested prior.
W.2 follow-on: the v4.12 throttle reused the ALERT set,
        so the census classified a debug-only handler as "pages". Own set now.
W.2: the v4.11 escalation guard was a bare `except: pass`
        inside place_exit_order — a SILENT swallow in the census's tier 1. Now
        DEBUG, once per process. No behaviour change.
EXIT LADDER LATENCY (N.5, log-only). place_exit_order() —
        the ONE seam every close routes through, paper and live — now stamps
        submit and fill instants, counts the passes the close took, flags
        escalation, and records the MARK AT TRIGGER. Written to the trade row
        via trade_logger v3.11 set_exit_latency() on a CONFIRMED close only.
        WHY THE MARK MATTERS MORE THAN THE MILLISECONDS: TC.2 has to choose a
        stop trigger (-40% vs 35% vs 25%) "calibrated against measured ladder
        fill-latency", and latency is not a cost until it is priced. The cost
        is (mark when the exit fired) - (price it actually filled at). Paper
        books the mark, so the two are equal by construction there — that
        equality is the PLUMBING PROOF that the capture is wired, not a result.
        The real distribution only exists in the live week.
        STATE LIVES ON THE RECORD, NOT ON THE ENGINE, because a live close is
        MULTI-TICK: the deadline can expire and the next tick RESUMES the same
        broker order. Keying off the record means submit_ts is the FIRST submit
        of that close attempt and the pass count spans the whole sequence; an
        engine-level counter would reset on restart and undercount exactly the
        slow closes the study is about.
        NOTHING IN THE TRADING PATH READS ANY OF IT. No exit decision, no
        price, no size changes — the capture runs after the FillResult exists.
CREDIT VERTICAL MANAGEMENT — the measurements, kept; the encodings, retired.
        The RATCHET (r90) and the TIME-GATED TP (r106) are both GONE. What the
        study actually established survives and is the reason they went:
        on 18 lone verticals a TP@25% turned -$242.77 into -$8.43, and on 28
        paired legs a TP was WORSE AT EVERY LEVEL — a credit vertical must never
        be closed on profit. The v2 text drew the opposite conclusion from its
        own numbers and shipped a TP anyway.
        WHAT MANAGES A CREDIT VERTICAL NOW: a 15% floor while it is alone,
        suppressed while a complement is open (closing one end of an offset pair
        leaves a full-sized naked position), the nickel as a DISPOSAL preference,
        the 15:45 close, and the roll. Nothing else.
CONTINUATION EXIT REWORK (user directive). Three changes,
        all scoped to _evaluate_continuation — no other strategy touched:
        (a) TRAIL ANCHORS TO 5m FVGs. It was passing df_1m straight into
            _update_fvg_trail, bypassing the _fvg_frame() helper that ORB and
            sweep have used since v3.8. 1m gaps on a trend-continuation runner
            are noise-tight tripwires; 5m gaps are structurally meaningful and
            naturally wider. Now routed through _fvg_frame(df_1m, df_5m), so
            it also inherits the graceful 1m fallback when 5m is thin.
        (b) THETA-BLEED ENABLED. _theta_bleed had exactly ONE call site
            (_evaluate_orb) — continuation had NO theta protection at all, so
            a stalled winner decayed untouched toward the floor. Now called,
            with its existing four gates unchanged: >=THETA_MIN_GAIN_PCT gain,
            below the FVG_TRAIL_ARM_PCT trail ceiling, past the
            THETA_MIN_HOLD_MIN 20-minute blackout, and projected calendar-day
            decay >= the gain. Placed AFTER exhaustion so the smarter signal
            (momentum divergence) gets first refusal in the narrow overlap;
            theta only catches the genuinely STALLED case.
        (c) BACKSTOP 40%% -> 25%% via CONTINUATION_STOP_LOSS_PCT. The floor
            fallback no longer borrows the blanket MAX_LOSS_PCT.
RUNNER REFINEMENTS (all config/env-tunable; see config
        v2.0). Goals: let winners run harder, keep the loss unit deliberate,
        give 0DTE gamma room to breathe.
        (a) FLOOR 25%→40% for directionals: the -25% premium floor front-ran
            the impulsive-origin structure stop on normal gamma retests,
            stopping intact theses on noise. Floor fallbacks now read
            MAX_LOSS_PCT; the hard-stop label carries the record's ACTUAL
            floor pct (old records keep 25%, truthfully). Sizing is
            full-premium based, so at $1000 positions a floored trade now
            costs ~$400 — the daily cap should be set accordingly.
            Butterflies stay at 25% (BUTTERFLY_STOP_LOSS_PCT); condors
            unchanged.
        (b) 5-MINUTE FVG TRAILS (USE_5M_FVG_TRAIL): trails anchor to 5m gaps
            — structurally meaningful, naturally wider. 1m remains
            authoritative for the structure stop and BOS (speed-critical).
            evaluate()/_evaluate_orb/_evaluate_sweep accept df_5m; graceful
            1m fallback when 5m is absent.
        (c) FVG FLOOR CLAMP (FVG_FLOOR_MAX_LOCK_PCT=0.90): an FVG hugging
            price can no longer set a floor tighter than 90% of current —
            both the armed FVG trail and the post-target trail are clamped.
        (d) LEASH UN-INVERTED: post-target no-FVG fallback 0.85→0.75
            (POST_TARGET_TRAIL_LOCK_PCT, now in config) — proven runners no
            longer get a shorter leash than unproven ones.
        (e) SWEEP RUNNER MODE (SWEEP_POST_TARGET_TRAIL, default on): the +100%
            target_hit — the one hard TP among directionals — is replaced by
            the ORB post-target trail; env False restores it for A/B.
        Telemetry companion: trade_logger v3.8 records per-trade MFE/MAE
        (max/min premium seen) so every threshold above is tunable from
        evidence.
LIVE FILL-CONFIRMATION IMPLEMENTED (closes the Fable spec).
        _confirm_and_book_live_exit() is no longer a stub: it submits the close,
        captures the broker order id, polls to a bounded deadline
        (LIVE_FILL_POLL_SECONDS / LIVE_FILL_DEADLINE_SECONDS in config), and
        returns confirmed=True ONLY on a broker-confirmed fill at the broker's
        actual net fill price read back from per-leg fills — never the mark,
        never entry, never $0.00. Unfilled-at-deadline → cancel, resolve the
        cancel/fill race, return confirmed=False (position STAYS OPEN; the
        15:45→16:00 retry loop re-attempts and it pages once per trade/kind).
        PARTIALS: filled portion stashed on the record, remainder resubmitted
        next tick at a fresh mark; books once, at the quantity-weighted net
        price — never a partial as whole. IDEMPOTENT: a working order id is
        stashed on the record and RESUMED on re-entry, so retry ticks can never
        double-submit a close. Also fixed on the way (all live-only):
        (a) condor-leg verticals now close as ONE 2-leg spread order
            (BUY_TO_CLOSE short / SELL_TO_CLOSE long) — they previously routed
            to _close_single_leg, which sold the short symbol (wrong action)
            and orphaned the long leg at the broker;
        (b) spread closes are marketable LIMITs (tastytrade rejects MARKET on
            multi-leg): vertical debit capped at spread width, butterfly credit
            floored at one tick — the old MARKET butterfly close would have
            been rejected every tick;
        (c) SDK signed-price convention verified (v13.x): NewOrder.price is
            negative=debit / positive=credit and price_effect is IGNORED — a
            positive-priced buy-to-close would never fill;
        (d) adopted short single legs BUY_TO_CLOSE instead of selling more.
        PAPER PATH UNTOUCHED. Acceptance tests A–E:
        tests/test_live_fill_confirmation.py. Spec:
        FABLE_SPEC_live_exit_fill_confirmation.md.
FILL-CONFIRMED EXIT CONTRACT. place_exit_order() now returns
        a FillResult (confirmed / fill_price / order_id / partial), not a bare
        bool — the SHARED seam between paper and live so the two can't fight.
        PAPER: simulate the fill at the last-known mark (passed in) and confirm
        it in one pass; if no mark, decline (confirmed=False) rather than invent
        a price. LIVE: routes to _confirm_and_book_live_exit(), which MUST book
        only on a broker-confirmed fill at the ACTUAL fill price — currently a
        fail-loud stub (raises NotImplementedError) so flipping to cash before
        it exists can NEVER book an unconfirmed close at a fabricated $0.00.
        _submit_live_close() retained (submission != fill) for Fable to call.
        See FABLE_SPEC_live_exit_fill_confirmation.md. Fixes the 15:45 hard-close
        batch that logged every leg at +$0.00 (booked at entry premium).
F5 FIX (exit-reason integrity; behaviorally neutral).
        position_manager used to overwrite record['stop_premium'] (+DB) with
        every trail update, so the floor checks here (ORB #1b, sweep #2,
        adopted #2) fired AT THE TRAIL LEVEL and labeled every trail-armed
        exit 'hard_stop_25pct'/'stop_hit'/'adopted_stop_long' — including
        post-target exits at +100%+. Exit LEVEL was always correct (it was
        the trail); the LABEL lied, poisoning exit_reason distributions for
        Phase-3 calibration. Now: stop_premium is immutable (the true entry
        -25% floor), trails persist in the new trail_stop column, and
        _seed_trail_from_record() re-arms the in-memory trail on restart so
        recovery survivability is preserved. Same exit ticks, same exit
        prices — only the labels change to the truth.
DOC SYNC (no logic change). Three docstrings in this file
        contradicted the code beneath them and were actively dangerous: an agent
        or engineer reading them would "correct" working code back into a fixed
        bug.
        (a) `_evaluate_orb`'s docstring still described the PRE-v3.1 stop ("1-min
            candle closes back inside ORB range") — precisely the behaviour v3.1
            replaced. Rewritten to the actual, ordered trigger list, and it now
            states explicitly that the -25% floor and the structure stop are an
            AND, that there is NO BOS on ORB, NO max-hold, and that the 11:00 ET
            cutoff expires the ENGINE and not an open position.
        (b) The v1.1 changelog line describing that same old stop is now marked
            [HISTORICAL — do not restore].
        (c) `_evaluate_butterfly`'s docstring claimed a 25% profit target; the
            live value is BUTTERFLY_TP_PCT = 20%.
        Zero executable lines changed — verified by diff.
ORB STRUCTURE STOP now keys off the IMPULSIVE candle's
        origin, not the range boundary. The old rule (v1.1) exited on a 1-min
        close back inside the ORB range (close < orb_high for a long). That is
        "just entering the range," which by the strategy's definition is NOT an
        invalidation — the trade is allowed to breathe inside the range as long
        as it holds the impulsive (break) candle's origin. The stop now fires
        only on a 1-min CLOSE beyond that origin: below the impulsive candle's
        low for a long, above its high for a short, read from record
        `underlying_stop` (set correctly by orb_engine v3.1). Companion to the
        engine fix; the two ship together. The unconditional -25% premium floor
        (v1.6) is UNCHANGED and still evaluated first every tick — structure
        stop and dollar floor are an AND (either exits), catching thesis-death
        and total-premium-loss independently. Contained to _evaluate_orb.
v3.0 — original release
strategy-aware exit routing:
        ORB:     stop on 1-min close back inside range, trail at 50% TP, no BOS
                 [HISTORICAL — the range-boundary stop was REPLACED in v3.1 by
                  the impulsive-origin stop. Do not restore. See v3.1 above.]
        Sweep:   BOS on 1-min structure, hard stop 25%
        Butterfly: time/premium exits only, no BOS, no trail
ORB no longer hard-exits at 100% TP. Past 100%, the trail
        tightens to track the nearest unfilled 1-minute Fair Value Gap on the
        underlying (in the trade\'s favor), giving the position room to wick
        back and fill the gap without exiting on every dip, while still
        protecting the bulk of gains if the move actually reverses. FVG
        detection is scoped to 1m data only, matching ORB entry/exit logic
        which is always evaluated on the 1-minute timeframe.
long-option THETA PROTECTION + generalized FVG trail:
        (a) theta-bleed exit — a profitable long is closed when projected time
            decay over THETA_LOOKAHEAD_MIN would erase the current gain (the
            clock, not price, is the threat). Uses live per-contract theta.
        (b) FVG-anchored trailing stop for ALL longs (ORB + Sweep), armed at
            +FVG_TRAIL_ARM_PCT: parks at the far edge of the nearest unfilled
            in-favor 1m FVG (room to continue), runs with the % trail (max wins).
ADOPTED-position exit path: manages a position discovered
        open at the broker on a LIVE restart with no DB plan (see
        broker_reconcile) by the universal core of our rules — sign-correct
        max-loss stop (long/short), long-side profit trail, 15:45 hard close.
        No strategy-specific context required.
theta-bleed REWORK (merged onto the v1.4 adopted-position
        path; supersedes the v1.3 theta logic that shipped inside v1.4). The
        v1.3 check fired on the first green tick: on 07-07 and 07-08, ~50-58 of
        ~77-87 exits were theta_bleed at a median ~60s hold, capping trends
        while the day's P&L came from the trades that reached the trail.
        _theta_bleed is now bounded by four gates: (1) a minimum gain floor,
        (2) a trail ceiling (once armed, the trail owns the trade — theta goes
        silent so trends run), (3) a MIN-HOLD blackout after entry, and (4) a
        corrected per-CALENDAR-day decay projection (v1.3/v1.4 divided by
        RTH_MINUTES=390, overstating projected decay ~3.7x). No call sites
        change; the adopted-position exit path (_evaluate_adopted) is untouched.
ORB UNCONDITIONAL -25% HARD FLOOR (critical risk fix). The
        -25% dollar failsafe is universal by design and sweep/butterfly/adopted
        all enforce it directly (if current_premium <= stop_prem). ORB was the
        lone exception: it routed its floor through _update_trail, which returns
        None below the +50% trail activation — so any ORB trade that never armed
        the trail ran with NO dollar-loss stop and could bleed toward zero while
        the structure stop held (CRM 2026-07-09: -83%, underlying still above the
        range, trail never armed). _evaluate_orb now checks the floor DIRECTLY and
        UNCONDITIONALLY right after the hard-close check, mirroring the other
        three paths. _update_trail is unchanged (its de-arm is correct for the
        TRAIL; the floor no longer depends on it). Known failure mode — the
        adopted path's own comment already flagged _update_trail's de-arm.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Exit triggers by strategy:
  ORB
    1. HARD CLOSE: 15:45 ET
    2. STRUCTURE STOP: 1-min close beyond the impulsive candle's origin
       (close < impulsive low for longs, close > impulsive high for shorts).
       Closing back inside the range alone does NOT stop — only a close past
       the impulsive origin does. Runs beside the unconditional -25% floor.
    3. TRAIL (below 100% TP): activates at 50% TP, trails at 75% of current premium
    4. TRAIL (at/past 100% TP): tightens to track the nearest unfilled 1m FVG
       in the trade\'s favor — no hard exit at target, position can keep running
  SWEEP REVERSAL
    1. HARD CLOSE: 15:45 ET
    2. HARD STOP: current premium <= 25% loss
    3. TARGET HIT: 100% TP
    4. BOS EXIT: 1-min break of structure against position
    5. TRAIL: activates at 50% TP
  BUTTERFLY
    1. HARD CLOSE: 15:45 ET
    2. MAX HOLD: 2.5 hours
    3. HARD STOP: net value <= 25% loss
    4. TARGET HIT: 25% of max profit
  ADOPTED (broker-discovered, no DB plan)
    1. HARD CLOSE: 15:45 ET
    2. MAX-LOSS STOP: sign-correct (long: premium <= stop; short: premium >= stop)
    3. LONG PROFIT TRAIL: standard trail to lock gains; short rides to hard close

    Both place_exit_order() modes return one of these; _execute_exit() books P&L

    the paper implementation (here, now) and the live broker-confirmation

                            confirmed result may ever mark a DB row closed.
        - confirmed=False → NOT filled. Book NOTHING, mark NOTHING closed. The
                            position stays open and the caller retries/escalates.
                            This is the anti-orphan invariant: an unconfirmed
                            live close must never become a $0.00 (or any) row.

    fill_price is the price the position ACTUALLY closed at — a simulated mark in

        occasionally declines to act.

        THE QUESTION NOTHING ELSE ASKS. `orb_structure_stop` asks whether the
        thesis broke; `_theta_bleed` asks whether a GAIN is about to evaporate
        (its gate 1 is a gain floor, so a LOSING position is invisible to it).
        A losing position that has STOPPED MOVING answers no to both, and the
        -40% percentage floor eventually catching it is the ABSENCE of a
        mechanism rather than one. On 2026-08-12 that cost a QQQ trade 50
        minutes and -42.2% while the underlying sat BELOW the short entry the
        entire time - directionally right, and bleeding anyway.

        NO TARGET IS USED. bev = |theta| / (|delta| * 1440) is the option's own
        physics, so this generalises to EVERY long-premium strategy rather than
        only ORB. The target-based form of the same idea was MEASURED AND
        REJECTED: feasibility ratio at entry ran HIGHER for losers than winners
        at every percentile (losers p50 5.05 vs winners 3.87, n=145) - a wide
        range gives a distant target AND a big required move, so feasibility and
        difficulty turn out to be the same axis pointing opposite ways. Do not
        reintroduce it.

        FOUR GATES:
          (1) GRACE    - no evaluation before VELOCITY_GRACE_MIN. Forced by the
                         data, not chosen: winners p10 at 5 minutes is -21.1,
                         i.e. the bottom decile of eventual WINNERS was moving
                         AWAY. Any earlier check kills those trades.
          (2) MEASURED - a strategy with no measured floor is evaluated and
                         LOGGED but never cut, whatever ENFORCE says.
          (3) FLOOR    - ratio must hold above winners-p10 * STRICTNESS at the
                         largest mark <= held.
          (4) CONFIRM  - VELOCITY_CONFIRM_TICKS consecutive breaches. QQQ crossed
                         back ABOVE breakeven at minutes 41-61 before dying at
                         70; a single-tick rule oscillates.

        # ── RATCHETING STOP (v4.1) ────────────────────────────────────────
        # Every stopped leg in the 07-07..07-22 sample was GREEN FIRST (median
        # peak +24% pre-fix / +31% post) then round-tripped into the -25% stop.

        # stays alive to reach the far band and complete the structure.
        # ⚠️ AUDIT F6 (2026-08-20): the stop was FLAT 25% from birth. TRADES.md
        # §5 is explicit — "BEFORE LEG 2 FILLS — leg 1 manages exactly like the
        # sweep credit spread: a 15% stop" — and names the 25% as "never
        # validated... calibrated for a complete structure collecting credit on
        # both sides — not for one naked leg" (condor_stop measured 16 trades,
        # 19% win, −$1,156). check_condor_spec stayed green because it asserted
        # a stub of its own (see its v4.1 entry). The threshold is derived at

        # Operator ruling: "The 25% stop should only apply to a lone vertical
        # spread — never the condor." The offset is the whole reason
        # full-sizing is safe (risk_manager.compute_condor_leg_size): the pair
        # cannot lose max on both ends, and a stop that closes one end
        # converts the structure back into a single full-sized directional
        # position with the hedge gone — 5 of 14 condor symbol-days had BOTH
        # sides stopped on a whipsaw. So while a complement is open the
        # per-leg premium stop (and its ratchet) is SUPPRESSED, and it RE-ARMS
        # the moment the leg is alone again — one-way suppression would leave
        # a naked full-sized position with no premium stop.
        # ⚠️ SUPPRESSED IS NOT UNMANAGED: the formed structure keeps the 15:45
        # close above, the nickel close below, and the roll.
        # 🔴 SETTLED 2026-09-05 (r269) — DO NOT RE-OPEN. There is NO further

# ⚠️ AUDIT F0 (2026-08-20) — THE CLASS WAS CUT IN HALF AND EVERY EXIT WAS DEAD.
# r38 landed `_track_excursion` as a module-level function PHYSICALLY INSIDE the
# class body region (column 0 at what was line 782). Python read it as the end
# of `class ExitEngine`; the ~2,000 lines below it — `evaluate` and all 33
# exit evaluators, indented as methods — silently became NESTED LOCAL FUNCTIONS
# of `_track_excursion`, created and discarded on each call, bound to nothing.
# The file compiled. `import main` passed. check_imports passed. Every checker
# passed, because NO CHECK EXECUTED AN EXIT. At runtime, the first
# `exit_eng.evaluate(...)` on any open position raised AttributeError into the
# loop's catch-all, every tick: no premium stop, no trail, no theta bleed, no
# nickel close, no condor ladder could ever fire — only the independent 15:45
# flatten_all() stood between an open position and the close. Found by the
# rewritten check_condor_spec (AUDIT F5), whose EXECUTING replacement raised
# the AttributeError its stub predecessor could never see. This function now
# lives where a module-level function belongs: BELOW the class it must not
# bisect. tests/check_exit_executes.py drives evaluate() so this class cannot
# fall apart silently again.

    """Record the best and worst mark this position has seen, and WHEN.

    v4.0. ⚠️ THE DATA EXISTED AND WAS THROWN AWAY. `TrailState.peak_close`
    updates every tick to drive the trailing stop and dies with the process, so
    the book could not answer **"how long until a winner declared itself"** -
    which is the number the sideways-grinder stop is made of. Same defect as
    `pin_concentration` and `flat_angle_deg`: computed every tick, used for a
    decision, never recorded.

    ⚠️ AND IT IS NOT `max_profit`. That column is written ONCE at entry from
    `signal.max_profit` - the THEORETICAL maximum of a defined-risk structure,
    not a realized excursion. Reading it as MFE reads a plan as an outcome.

    ⚠️ BARS ARE COUNTED, NOT TIMED. A wall-clock delta would be wrong across a
    halt or a feed gap; the tick count is what the position actually saw.
    Failure here must never reach the exit decision - a telemetry write is not
    worth a missed stop - so everything is guarded.
