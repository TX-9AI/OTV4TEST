risk/risk_manager.py  v4.6
v4.6 2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r93 — _size_geometry REFUSES a stop inside the noise floor,
      before any sizing arithmetic, with the floor NAMED in the reason.
      Operator's ruling 2026-09-22: refuse, not floor. Section 36 FEASIBILITY —
      a setup whose stop the tape crosses within one bar cannot pay. A zero
      floor disarms the gate (pre-r93 behaviour) and distance <= 0 stays the
      DEGENERATE case, not a noise-floor refusal.
v4.5  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r91 — A STOP WIDER THAN THE RANGE IS NO LONGER
      DEGENERATE. That branch forced ONE CONTRACT whenever `distance > width`,
      bypassing the risk budget entirely — measured at distance 2.00 on a 1.02
      range: 1 contract, $80 deployed against a $1,050 target. It made sense
      while GEOMETRY set the size; it does not now that RISK does, and a deep
      impulsive candle is a legitimate setup the operator's own rule already
      handles (wide stop -> small position). Operator: *"I DO NOT want $30 ORB
      TRADES."* ⚠️ `distance <= 0` is STILL degenerate and still sizes 1.
v4.4  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r44 — THE ORB GEOMETRY RULE GAINS A SCALE.
      🔑 THE OPERATOR'S MODEL WAS RIGHT AND IS KEPT — tight stop big, wide stop
      small. The algebra shows why it was never enough: contracts = width/dist
      and risk/contract = dist x delta x 100, so total risk = width x delta x
      100 and the DISTANCE CANCELS. The rule is exactly risk-normalised — to a
      constant set by the OPENING RANGE rather than the risk budget. Measured on
      a 0.97 range: every stop from 0.54 to 0.01 risked $26-32 while the count
      swung 1 to 80. `by_risk` is the same 1/distance curve with the constant
      the operator banks against. ⚠️ A MISSING STOP PREMIUM FALLS BACK TO
      GEOMETRY — my first cut used `premium - 0`, a constant that flattened the
      curve to one count at every distance; check_orb_budget B3 caught it.
v4.3  2026-08-31  r201 — ORB GEOMETRY IS CLAMPED BY A BUDGET. `min(geometry,
      floor(budget / cost_per_contract))`, and the operator's scaling curve
      falls out of the two clamps meeting rather than needing a ramp. A
      single contract dearer than the whole budget REFUSES rather than
      flooring to one, matching `_size_budget`. Both clamps are recorded on
      the result so a future budget change is a query, not a guess.
v4.2  2026-08-30  r192 — ONE SIZING HANDLER, FOUR RULES, KEYED ON STRUCTURE.
      Operator: "normalize the entry sizing, but use the stop size logic we
      just wrote for orb specifically, and make it active — it shipped
      inert/broken."
      🔴 THE BUG THIS FIXES STRUCTURALLY, NOT JUST ONCE. r181 computed ORB's
      geometry count IN THE CALLER (main.py) and assigned it to
      `signal.contracts` — a field written four times and read ZERO times
      tree-wide — while `entry_engine.enter()` ordered `sizing.contracts`.
      Every ORB trade since the 08-28 bake has been a 1-lot while the log
      printed "[orb-size] r181 geometry: ... -> N (was M)". A rule applied
      by the CALLER is the only one of the four that can compute a number the
      order never sees. Now every rule returns a SizingResult and the order
      reads only SizingResult.contracts, which makes the failure
      UNREPRESENTABLE rather than merely corrected.
      🔑 NOTE WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: entry_engine is untouched. It already
      ordered `sizing.contracts`; it was the sizer that was not answering.
      That is the test of whether this refactor is the right one.
      ⚠️ KEYED ON `structure`, THE SAME KEY `_afternoon_debit_blocked` USES,
      not on a strategy-name list. That lesson is already paid for: the v3
      cutoff held a name list, two of its three entries were deleted, and the
      new long-debit strategy was silently EXEMPT. A name list rots every
      time a strategy moves, AND IT ROTS PERMISSIVELY. Unknown structure
      falls to the budget rule, which is the restrictive one.
      ⚠️ THE ARITHMETIC OF THE THREE EXISTING RULES IS UNCHANGED — this is a
      move, not a rewrite. `tests/check_sizing_parity.py` pins 25 golden rows
      captured from THIS FILE AT r191 before the refactor, across all three.
      🔴 ORB GEOMETRY BYPASSES THE BUDGET ENTIRELY, by the operator's 08-28
      ruling ("NO notional cap for ORB ... I'm actually good, even with the
      worst case taking the 25% floor on a leveraged position with a tight
      stop"). CONSEQUENCE, STATED PLAINLY BECAUSE IT IS NEW BEHAVIOUR AND NOT
      MERELY AN ACTIVATION: the budget path could REFUSE an ORB entry outright
      with `insufficient_capital` when one contract cost more than the risk
      budget. Geometry has no such rung, so those setups now trade at >=1 lot
      where they previously did not fire at all. Only a non-positive premium
      still refuses. The notional is logged on every geometry size so the
      number is visible rather than inferred.
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Position sizing, loss caps, halt state.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

risk/risk_manager.py — Position sizing and session circuit breaker. v3.3
FIX NameError on the condor-leg SUCCESS path: the v3.2
        full-budget change renamed the budget variable (half -> leg_budget)
        but the logger.info f-string still referenced the DELETED old name,
        so every sizing that produced >=1 contract raised NameError AT THE
        LOG LINE (found by check_versions' absence canary in the 2026-07-23
        header audit; reproduced: spread_width=5.0, credit=0.50, risk=1050
        -> NameError). Log now prints leg_budget. No sizing-math change.
        (The old variable name is deliberately not written here — the
        absence canary greps this file for it, prose included.)
compute_condor_leg_size() now sizes each vertical at the
        FULL grade budget (was half). See the method docstring. (Relabeled in
        the 2026-07-23 header audit: this entry originally shipped mis-numbered
        v1.4 — the file was already at v3.1.)
SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT import removed (constant deleted in config
        v3.2). It gated nothing: record_loss() has requested a reassessment on
        EVERY loss since v1.4. The session_losses COUNTER is kept as a statistic.
        The only halt is, and always was, the NET DOLLAR cap DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD.
DAILY CAP MADE DEFINITIVE & RESTART-PROOF:
        (a) is_halted() now reads the day's realized net P&L straight from the
            DB (trade_logger.realized_pnl_today()) on EVERY entry attempt — the
            single source of truth, identical to what query.py/status.py show.
            It no longer trusts an in-memory flag, so a restart (manual, deploy,
            or Restart=always after a crash) can't clear the halt: the loss is
            in trades.db and is re-read immediately. This is the bug that let
            AVGO resume trading after a 09:48 restart wiped the in-memory halt.
        (b) The cap binds to the SAME risk-per-trade the manager is constructed
            with (the value used for sizing), not the module-level
            DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD frozen at import; explicit OT_DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT
            still overrides. Removes the drift that showed a $200 default while
            sizing ran at $1050. update_risk() keeps the cap in lockstep.
        (c) reset_session() no longer sets _seeded=True (that line defeated the
            DB re-seed); a fresh process re-reads the day's realized P&L.
v1.0 — original release
remove TRADE_GRADE_C and Twilio references,
        clean up Grade C sizing logic
        at a count threshold). (b) NET daily loss halt: track session net P&L
        (seeded from today's closed trades so it survives restarts) and halt
        NEW entries when day P&L <= -DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD. Wins offset losses —
        a green day keeps trading. Open positions still exit normally.
add compute_condor_leg_size(): sizes ONE condor vertical
        at HALF the grade budget (each side gets half), against the spread
        max-loss = (width - credit) x 100. Enables two independent verticals.
session loss limit no longer halts the session. Hitting
        main loop) instead of stopping the service. Rationale: a 2-loss count
        breaker was too blunt — it would kill sessions that are still net
        profitable. Removed _fire_circuit_breaker()/systemctl-stop and the
        session_halted semantics.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Sizing model:
  - Fixed dollar risk per trade (operator-set at startup)
  - Contracts = floor(risk_usd × grade_multiplier / cost_per_contract)
  - cost_per_contract = mark × 100 (single leg) or net_debit × 100 (butterfly)
  - Always whole contracts; minimum 1 if affordable
  - EVERY losing trade sets a one-shot reassessment request (v1.4). A loss is
    count threshold — the old SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT count was deleted in config
    v3.2 (it had gated nothing since v1.4). `session_losses` is retained purely
    classification. Trading continues; the bot re-reads the market.
  - NOTE (live): this intentionally removes the hard stop. For live capital a
    separate $-based session backstop is advisable — not implemented here.

            # 🔑 THE OPERATOR'S MODEL IS CORRECT AND IS KEPT: a tight stop takes
            # a large position, a wide stop a small one, *"because we're
            # accepting massive risk on a turn back"*. `width // distance` says
            # that perfectly. What it does NOT say is HOW MUCH — and the algebra
            # is why:
            #     contracts     = width / distance
            #     risk/contract = distance x delta x 100
            #     total risk    = width x delta x 100     <- distance CANCELS
            # The rule is exactly risk-normalised, and normalises to a constant
            # SET BY THE OPENING RANGE rather than by the risk budget.
            # 🔴 MEASURED 2026-09-18 on a 0.97-wide range: EVERY stop distance
            # from 0.54 down to 0.01 produced a total risk of $26-$32 — 3% of
            # the box's $1,050 per-trade budget — while the contract count swung
            # from 1 to 80. The ORB rode a 3.46pt move to +48.4% and banked $60.
            # ⚠️ SAME SHAPE, NOT A NEW ONE. `by_risk` is also proportional to
            # 1/distance, because `premium - stop_premium` IS the distance in
            # premium terms. It is the identical curve with the constant the
            # operator actually banks against, so nothing about the tight/wide
            # behaviour changes — only where the whole curve sits.
            # ⚠️ IT FAILS BACK TO GEOMETRY. No usable stop premium means no
            # risk-per-contract, and inventing one would size on a number
            # nobody measured.
            # 🔴 A MISSING STOP PREMIUM MUST FALL BACK, NOT GUESS — AND MY FIRST
            # CUT DID GUESS. With `stop_premium` absent it defaults to 0, so
            # `premium - 0` is the WHOLE premium: a constant that does not move
            # with the stop, which flattened the sizing curve to the same count
            # at every distance and destroyed the operator's tight/wide shape
            # outright. `check_orb_budget` B3 caught it — stops 0.10 through
            # 10.0 all returned 2 lots. The risk scale is only meaningful when
