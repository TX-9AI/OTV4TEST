v1.4  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r225 (FLY.2) — records the same three leg-quote facts as the pin butterfly on the wings it picks (gex_pin_butterfly.leg_quote_facts). Log-only.
v1.3  2026-09-30  OTV4TEST r179 (BFLY.9) — THE ATP FLY'S OWN PIN-CONCENTRATION FLOOR, 0.15.
      The operator, 2026-09-30, reading the ATP fly HOLD all afternoon on a PINNING tape at the pin: "The ATP fly should be accepting the plan for the EXACT reason GEX pin fly is declining (price too close to pin)", then "Drop the ATP to .19" and, minutes later, "Actually .15 sounds better".
      MEASURED that day: PINNING at 745, spot 0.5-1.5 off the pin, a 743/745/747 fly PREPARED at
      about 0.40 for R 4.0, and all 148 ticks from 12:00 to 12:40 ET waiting on this one condition
      (concentration 0.18-0.20 against the shared 0.25; the pin 2.0 from VWAP, so no waiver). The
      regime needs only 0.15 to read PINNING, so between 0.15 and 0.25 the pin fly declined for
      being too close and this fly declined for a weak pin. `PIN_CONC_MIN` here reads
      config.ATP_BFLY_PIN_CONC_MIN. ROUTE B, ruled the same afternoon: The operator, 2026-09-30: "Allow a non-pinning ATP if it qualifies on STRICT VWAP & NOT TRENDING", "Route B for VWAP if A fails", and yes to NEUTRAL and to ±0.05 x EM.
      So the fly qualifies on ROUTE A - PINNING and concentration >= 0.15 - or, only when A
      fails, on ROUTE B - a regime that is NOT TRENDING (PINNING or NEUTRAL, never unknown) with
      the pin within ±0.05 x EM of today's VWAP, read through anchors.vwap_now(), which fails
      closed on a missing or stale VWAP. This fly no longer calls the shared `pin_strength()`
      (whose waiver band is 0.10 x EM); the pin fly still does and is unchanged. The route that
      admitted a fly is named in its plan row and noted on the tick.
v1.2  2026-09-30  OTV4TEST r178 (CAP.2) — COMMENT ONLY. The header below said the
      once-per-session cap counts BOTH butterflies; that stopped being true at r85
      (2026-09-21: each butterfly has its OWN session quota - both fired on 09-22),
      and the stale line was quoted to the operator as fact on 2026-09-30. Corrected.
      Also recorded: both butterflies are exempt from the daily catastrophic loss
      cap (position_manager v5.9, main v4.78). No code changes here.
v1.1  2026-09-17  OTV4TEST r31 (BFLY.7) — the pinning REGIME stamped on the row,
      record-only and at ZERO WEIGHT, the same `derived/gamma_regime.read()` the
      travel fly stamps, so the two butterflies cannot disagree about the regime any
      more than they can about pin strength (v1.0 shares `pin_strength`). Concentration
      says WHERE gamma is; this says whether the pinning regime exists at all — on
      2026-09-16 the two disagreed for six hours. `GAMMA_RAMP_WEIGHT` is 0.0, so
      nothing here is sized by it (§31); see BFLY.8 for why it stays that way.
v1.0  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r26 — THE ATP BUTTERFLY'S PLAN (PLAN_SPEC §39, BFLY.6).
      Operator, 2026-09-13: *"that is a different trade. Code it and allow one
      butterfly or the other, whichever plan produces a viable trade 1st can take
      it. Call it something different, because traveling to the pin is a
      different thesis than building it on an already sideways tape."* — and he
      named it the ATP (at-the-pin) butterfly.

      THE THESIS. GEXPinButterfly buys a fly for price to TRAVEL to a pin 0.30-1.00
      of the expected move away, with its wings never crossing spot. The ATP fly
      is built where that trade refuses to: price is ALREADY AT the pin and the
      tape has been sitting there. On Friday 09-11 the travel fly refused 696
      ticks because price was too close to the pin for any wing — the tape this
      trade exists for.

      THE CONDITIONS (the priors are declared in config and recorded every tick):
        entry_window       the butterfly slot, shared with GEXPinButterfly
        enabled            ATP_BUTTERFLY_ENABLED
        pinning            GEX environment PINNING with a pin strike
        pin_concentration  `gex_pin_butterfly.pin_strength` — the SAME function the
                           travel fly uses, with THIS fly's own floor since r179:
                           conc >= 0.15 (the travel fly's is 0.25), or the pin
                           within ±0.10 x EM of today's VWAP (r25)
        expected_move      from the chain's ATM IV, no fallback
        at_pin             |price - pin| <= ATP_BFLY_AT_PIN_EM_FRAC x EM ⟨PRIOR 0.30⟩
                           — the exact complement of the travel fly's reach, so on
                           any one tick at most one of the two can be viable
        settled            the last ATP_BFLY_SETTLED_BARS ⟨PRIOR 15⟩ CLOSED 1m bars
                           all closed inside that band — "an already sideways
                           tape", READ FROM THE CANDLES (DEC.1), never counted in
                           memory. The value is how many consecutive closed bars
                           back from now are inside, so a HOLD says how far along
      ⚠️ NO TICK-PERSISTENCE COUNTER AND NO PLAYED-PIN SET. The travel fly's
      `_persist` and `PLAYED_PINS` live in process memory (DEC.1 debt, recorded);
      this plan's persistence is the settled-bars read, and its once-per-session is
      main.py's trades.db cap - ONE ATP fly per session, counted on its own name
      (r85; the pin fly has its own quota, and both may fire on one day).

      THE STRUCTURE. Both sides priced (at the pin neither is "the OTM side"); every
      symmetric wing from the LISTED strikes, apex exactly on the pin; a wing must
      put spot INSIDE the tent (width > |price - pin|); R >= R_FLOOR; the stop at
      BUTTERFLY_STOP_LOSS_PCT must clear the fly's own three-leg spread by
      STOP_VS_SPREAD_MIN. The pick is the MAX R (the r6 ruling for butterflies).

      MEASURED BEFORE BUILDING (this box, 12:00-15:00): Wed 09-09 and Thu 09-10 —
      no qualifying minute (GEX read TRENDING); Fri 09-11 — 36 qualifying minutes,
      first 12:28 (pin 715, spot 716.01, EM 5.21, conc 0.26). On Friday's real 12:28
      quotes the search takes the 713/715/717 PUT fly: debit 0.56, R 2.57, stop 0.224
      = 5.6x its 0.04 spread (the 1-wide leaves spot outside the tent; the 713/715/717
      CALL fly fails at 1.6x). Its worst mid to the flatten was 0.38 at 13:25 against
      a 0.336 stop — it survives by four cents — and it was worth 1.135 at 15:44.
      One day is a mechanism, not a rule.
