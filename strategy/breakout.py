strategy/breakout.py  v1.4
THE SPECIFICATION. The plan searches; this declares what it must find.

v1.4  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r84 — THE PLAN IS BUILT IN `__init__`, NOT ON
      FIRST USE. Lazily constructing it meant `BreakoutPlan()` only ever
      existed inside 09:35-11:30, so outside its window Breakout was in NO
      registry: no heartbeat, absent from the board, and nothing could tell
      "not yet constructed" from "crashed". r77 in a different costume — a
      lazy IMPORT there, a lazy CONSTRUCTION here. The import stays deferred
      (breakout_plan imports this module back); only the construction moves.
v1.3  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r59 — `accepts_fitted()`. ROUTING IS NOT ADMISSION:
      while acceptance reads "any" nothing is ever unmet, so a fade route keyed
      on the live verdict is DEAD for the whole window. Routing reads the dial.
v1.2  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r55 — THE OBSERVER POSTURE, AND THE WIDTH BAND WAS
      ANTI-SELECTIVE. Operator: "trade every break that gets a 1-minute candle
      acceptance beyond the boundary… informers are just observers for 2 weeks."
      `observe_only()` auto-expires at BRK_OBSERVE_UNTIL and FAILS CLOSED.
      🔴 orb_range MEASURED ANTI-SELECTIVE on n=747 — it refused 38% of breaks
      and kept the worse half (0.94x in, 1.10x out). Widened to feasibility-only.
      ROOM_MIN_R recategorised FOUNDATIONAL -> SELECTION: a resting pool is
      EVIDENCE about a break, not part of what makes it a Breakout.
v1.1  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r53 — `flow_commit` STOPS BEING A PRIOR. Measured
      over 255 fleet breaks with prints: signed imbalance >= +0.10 lifts the 1R
      rate from 52.5% to 65.1% (1.24x, keeps 33%). The prior was 0.15, which
      measured 61.3% — right neighbourhood, slightly too strict.
      🔴 AND `tagged_frac` NEVER BINDS: median 1.00, p10 1.00 over the same
      sample. Kept as insurance against a degraded feed, labelled as insurance
      rather than evidence.
v1.0  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r51 (BRK.1) — the operator's 5-minute opening range
      breakout, taken WITHOUT a retest.

WHY IT EXISTS, IN HIS WORDS. The ORB *"is typically a loser… which is crazy
because we're waiting for the level to prove itself before entering."* **The
retest IS that wait.** This trade pays for immediacy with EVIDENCE gathered at
the moment of the break instead of with time.

🔑 THIS FILE IS A DECLARATION, NOT A SEARCH (PLAN_SPEC §10). Operator,
2026-09-18: *"The strategy file is the specification. It lists the bars that
must be cleared to execute the trade. The plan file is what searches the feed
every tick for the nearest qualifying setup that satisfies the strategy… If it
can't satisfy every single hurdle then it doesn't put forward a plan. The plan
exists for the sole purpose of forming the trigger the strategy executes on.
Literally A, B, C was satisfied at X strike, execute if/when it reaches."*
So: this holds NO chain, picks NO strike, and reads NO feed. It states the
bars; `breakout_plan.py` clears them and hands back a trigger.

⚠️ EVERY CONSTANT BELOW IS A DECLARED PRIOR, AND TWO ARE MEASURED FACTS THAT
CONTRADICT AN EARLIER PRIOR. They are named here, in one place, so a study can
move them without hunting through the plan.
  🔴 VOLUME EXPANSION IS NOT A CONDITION. Measured 2026-09-18 over 736 fleet
     breaks (every warehouse `ohlc` object back to 2026-07-08): the break bar's
     volume multiple does NOT separate a break that reached +1R from one that
     was stopped — medians 0.62 vs 0.59 on the ORB baseline, and the best
     threshold on any of four baselines lifted the hit rate from 50.9% to
     55.3% (1.08x, n=266). **The operator predicted this before the study
     ran:** *"one of the characteristics of a fakeout is taking out stops and
     then turning the other way."* Stops are market orders, so a harvest
     MANUFACTURES the volume spike — it describes that a break happened, never
     whether it holds. It is recorded as context, never gated on.
  🔑 ROOM TO RUN IS THE ONE GATE WITH EVIDENCE, AND IT IS A BINARY. Same study,
     n=327 with a liquidity ledger: breaking into OPEN AIR reached 1R 63.0% of
     the time against 49.5% with a named pool ahead (base 51.4%). ⚠️ n=46 on
     the open-air arm, a standard error near 7 points — suggestive, not
     established. The DISTANCE bands did not behave monotonically (0–0.5R beat
     0.5–1.0R), most likely because a pool that close IS the level that formed
     the range, so no distance threshold is declared.

# that un-bypasses it is code nobody has run.
# 🔑 THE FIT DOES NOT NEED A NARROW BAND TO BE POSSIBLE. Every informer's

# afterwards from the values themselves — more than a stored boolean verdict
# could have given us.
# 🔑 AND "ALL" IS WHAT MAKES THE OPERATOR'S INVARIANT TRUE: *"if we do get an
# orb trade a breakout trade should've preceded it, because it's the same trade
# but without the retest."* That holds only while Breakout's acceptance is no
# narrower than the ORB's, and the ORB has no width band, no cleanliness rule,
# no pool rule and no R floor. Narrow any of these before the fit and an ORB
# trade can fire that Breakout refused — the two diverge, silently.

        components provided by the plan are in place to fire."* The plan's job
        ended when it handed over a trigger — a strike, a stop, an R, and the
        named conditions that must still hold. This re-reads those components
        against THIS tick and fires only if every one is in place.
        ⚠️ IT DOES NOT RE-DERIVE THEM. Re-searching here would make this a
        second plan, which is exactly the duplication PLAN_SPEC §10 removes; it
        reads what `prepare()` recorded and judges it.
        ⚠️ AND THE CHECK IS NOT REDUNDANT WITH `ready`. `ready` is the PLAN's
        verdict that a qualifying setup exists. This is the STRATEGY's verdict
        that it is still true now, and the two are different questions the same
        way a signed contract and a settled trade are different events.
