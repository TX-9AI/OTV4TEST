"""
strategy/breakout_plan.py  v1.11
v1.11 2026-10-05  OTV4TEST r254 (OBS.1) — THE PLAN ALWAYS LOOKS, THE STRATEGY IS GATED ON THE HOUR: Breakout, Runaway and the Hunt are OBSERVED from their entry end to 15:40 - asked, recorded LOG-ONLY, never executed (the operator, 2026-10-05: "the plan always looks, but the strategies are gated on the hour of the day"; "Have those blocked TRADES just to Log only"). Here: past LATEST_ET the plan keeps looking only while observed (the r220 window line is unchanged).
v1.10 2026-10-05  OTV4TEST r251 (BRK.6) — ON A CASH INDEX THE TAPE AND THE BOOK ARE NOT APPLICABLE, NEVER A REFUSAL.
      SPX has no time-and-sale and no resting size: on 2026-10-05 flow_imbalance and depth_ratio were None on 220 of 220
      SPX ticks (every print in SPX-TEST's store was AAL's; SPX's 6,046 Quote rows carried bid/ask size 0), so
      flow_commit FAILED every tick and Breakout could not trade SPX by construction (mainline's SPX book: 0 Breakout
      in 192 trades). The operator, 11:09 ET: "I agree and we have to get SPX Trading those breakouts"; 11:28 ET, on
      depth too: "Yes, do it." On config.is_cash_index(symbol), flow_commit (with its flow_tagged half) and depth_thin
      record "n/a - cash index, no tape" / "no book" and are MET - before acceptance is asked, so it holds after the
      research window closes (10-30). The raw readings are still recorded. _route's `fading` no longer counts an
      index's absent book as a failing one (it routed SPX's 10:16-10:18 break as a HARVEST on that alone). Found and
      authored on SPX-TEST. Anything that is not a cash index: unchanged, a missing reading still refuses.
v1.9  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r220 (TIME.1) — the private parser is utils.time_utils.parse_hm; an unreadable window BOUND now closes the window (it read as 00:00, i.e. open since midnight).
v1.8  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r218 (PATH.1) — QUOTE_FLOOR is read from config with no getattr fallback (config now defines it, value unchanged 0.01).
v1.7  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r188 (BRK.5) — depth_thin FINALLY HAS A READING. `_depth` read
      `depth_now` / `depth_before`, keys `analysis/order_flow.depth()` has never
      returned (it returns bid/ask sizes and bid_depth_ratio / ask_depth_ratio), so
      the reading was None on 2,153 of 2,153 plan_check rows 09-21..10-02 and the
      informer recorded nothing for the whole research window. Now the depletion
      is read off the side AHEAD of price - the ask for a long, the bid for a
      short - as 1 - <side>_depth_ratio (positive = thinning, as documented).
      The operator, 2026-10-03: "on the very next session that it TRADES make
      sure that we're getting the right data." RECORD-ONLY BY MEASUREMENT on
      QQQ: acceptance is "any" until 2026-10-30 (config v4.46), and the one
      fitted-dial reader, `_route`'s `fading`, runs only when a bar is unmet -
      flow_imbalance was present on 2,153 of 2,153 ticks and 0 DEFER lines are in
      bot.log since 09-08. On a box whose flow goes missing, a pooled break's
      routing could now differ (depth no longer reads as failing).
v1.6  2026-09-25  OTV4TEST r142 — A RE-FIRE IS JUDGED ON A BAR THAT CLOSED AFTER THE
      LAST ENTRY. r131's gate compared the signal bar (df_1m[-2], the last CLOSED
      bar) with every RTH bar BEFORE it - and the signal bar can be the SAME bar
      that fired the previous entry. 2026-09-25: a long fired at 09:36:16 on the
      09:35 close (743.87 over the 09:30-09:34 high 743.68) and stopped out 33s
      later; at 09:36:51 the 09:35 bar was STILL the last closed bar, so the
      re-fire passed the same test on the same close while the session high was
      the 09:35 bar's own 744.10. -$1,250. Operator: "A new high for a long".
      Now a re-fire also needs its signal bar to START at or after the minute of
      the side's latest entry, so it closed after that entry; the session extreme
      then includes the bar that fired before. `side_entries_today` is the one
      trades.db read; `side_fired_today` is its count, unchanged for its callers.
v1.5  2026-09-24  OTV4TEST r131 — A RE-FIRE NEEDS A NEW EXTREME (gate
      `new_extreme`, FOUNDATIONAL, declared in breakout.py GATES). THE
      OPERATOR, 2026-09-24: *"A new reclaimed level has to happen before it
      can fire again? A new high for a long, a new low for a short."* The
      trigger below was a STATE (the last closed bar still beyond the edge)
      with no latch, so on 09-24 it fired 18 times into one range. Now the
      FIRST entry per side per session keeps that trigger unchanged; EVERY
      LATER entry on that side needs the last closed 1m bar to CLOSE above
      the highest HIGH of every prior RTH bar since 09:30 (long) / below the
      lowest LOW (short). Strictly beyond, no tolerance — closes are
      acceptance. Tape simulation, QQQ 38 sessions, +2R/-1R
      (/var/tmp/compression_study/results_refire_sim.txt): +24.0R against
      -8.0R as built; trend days +44R vs +22R; chop -9R vs -24R. (13 symbols
      08-24..09-18: -70.2R vs -125.8R — less bad, not positive.)
      🔑 "ALREADY FIRED" IS READ FROM trades.db (DEC.1, the runaway's
      `break_last_exit` path): any Breakout row entered this session on this
      side, win or loss, open or closed. A restart cannot reset it.
      🔑 THE SESSION EXTREME IS READ FROM THE FEED STORE, NOT df_1m: the
      frame main.py passes is TIMEFRAMES["1m"] = 60 bars ROLLING (config.py
      r95 block), so by 10:37 it no longer holds 09:30-09:36 and its high
      would silently shrink. Both reads FAIL CLOSED with the gate named.
      Placed AFTER the router and BEFORE the contract: routing (DEFER/PERMIT)
      is untouched; only a TAKE that re-fires without a new extreme is refused.
v1.4  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r91 — carries `entry_delta`, same as the ORB.
      ⚠️ PARITY IS THE POINT: Breakout exists to be the ORB without the
      retest, so a sizing input one supplies and the other does not would make
      the operator's A/B a comparison of two sizers instead of two entries.
THE SEARCH. Every tick, for the setup that satisfies `strategy/breakout.py`.

v1.3  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r77 — emit() imported OptionsSignal from
      `strategy.structure`, which does not export it. ImportError on EVERY tick
      from 09:37:04; 127 crashes in one session and NOT ONE Breakout trade,
      ever. Lazy import, so check_imports passed; _safe_strategy caught the
      raise, so the board showed a stale skip label instead of a crash.
v1.2  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r59 — the FADE route read `prep.unmet`, which is
      EMPTY while acceptance is "any", so DEFER->HUNT / DEFER->SWEEP could not
      fire for the whole research window. Reads the FITTED dials, like `pooled`.
v1.1  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r55 — THE INFORMERS ARE DIALS, NOT A BYPASS.
      Operator: "I still want the informer set as triggers in the strategy
      package, but set the acceptance to 'any'." An earlier cut made them SKIP
      `cond()`; he ruled against it and he was right — a bypass has to be
      un-bypassed later, and that code is code nobody has run. Every bar is a
      real trigger again; `B.accepts(bar, value)` carries the acceptance.
      ⚠️ The FADE route reads the FITTED dial, not the live acceptance: while
      acceptance is "any" every pool distance clears room_to_run, so asking
      "did room_to_run fail?" would never route a harvest to the sweep.
      Declares `sizes_on_geometry` so it sizes as the ORB does.
v1.0  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r51 (BRK.1).

🔑 WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, IN THE OPERATOR'S WORDS (2026-09-18): *"The plan file
is what searches the feed every tick for the nearest qualifying setup that
satisfies the strategy. The plan knows exactly what bars must be cleared in
order to deliver a working plan to the strategy. If it can't satisfy every
single hurdle then it doesn't put forward a plan. The plan exists for the sole
purpose of forming the trigger the strategy executes on. Literally A, B, C was
satisfied at X strike, execute if/when it reaches."*

So the OUTPUT of this file is a TRIGGER and nothing else: every declared bar
already TRUE, a strike selected, a stop and an R that clear the floor — and one
thing left pending, which the strategy confirms on the next tick.

🔑 AND IT ROUTES RATHER THAN MERELY REFUSING. Operator: *"if we identify that
it's a fakeout before it happens, maybe we can tip off the appropriate trade to
take that."* When the bars fail in the shape that says HARVEST — a pool sitting
where the stops are, a pinning regime, depth refilling after the sweep — this
plan does not go quiet. It `permit()`s, which `strategy/plan.py` defines as
*"a PERMISSION, not a signal… the plan's terminal for an informer"*, and writes
a PERMIT row so the account separates "informed another strategy" from "took a
trade". **The breakout and the fade are ONE SETUP READ TWO WAYS**, which is why
one search can decide both.

⚠️ THE BREAK IS A CLOSE, NEVER A WICK (r5). That single bar is the anti-fakeout
gate that costs nothing in TIME — which is the whole reason this trade can skip
the retest the ORB waits for.
