strategy/management.py  v2.5
v2.5  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r51 (BRK.1) — THE BREAKOUT'S EXHAUSTION EXIT, and
      the first reader `_midline_atr` / `_momentum_divergence` have ever had.
      Both survived, fully written and documented, from an `_evaluate_continuation`
      path deleted with the strategy it served: MEASURED, ZERO CALL SITES.
      Operator: *"the liquidity hunt has an identified target and the breakout
      has to identify an EXHAUSTION SIGNAL to get out before it gives back."*
      Two tiers, order preserved from the original doctrine: EXTENSION tightens
      (a strong trend can stay extended), DIVERGENCE exits (continuing on fumes).
      ⚠️ MODE 2, NOT MODE 3 — the stricter both-signals form the operator asked
      for is deliberately NOT taken here: a first wiring and a behaviour change
      in one step cannot be told apart when the result arrives.
v2.4  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r26 — THE ATP BUTTERFLY IS MANAGED EXACTLY AS THE PIN BUTTERFLY.
      Covered, with the same two declared exits (the 40% floor and the 15:45
      flatten, no target). Every "is this the butterfly" test reads one tuple,
      `BUTTERFLIES`, so a third butterfly cannot be half-managed by a name
      comparison someone forgot.
v2.3  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r24 — THE DECLARATIONS MATCH THE ROWS AGAIN. The sweep's
      premium stop is the credit plus 15% OF THE RISK (PLAN_SPEC §31) — this
      line read "credit x (1 + max_loss_pct)", the inverted rule the stamp was
      still writing — and the butterfly's floor is 40% (operator's ruling).
      The plan still acts on each record's own `stop_premium`, so a position
      opened before r24 keeps the floor it was opened with.
v2.2  2026-08-27  r169: the butterfly declares exactly two exits — the 25%
      floor and the 15:45 flatten; the target no longer fires for it.
v2.1  2026-08-27  r168: the runaway declares NO structure stop — its floor is
      the 20% premium loss on the record; the breach check cannot fire for it
      because the signal carries no underlying_stop.
v2.0  2026-08-27  r167 — THE PLAN DECIDES; THE EXIT ENGINE CALCULATES AND
      EXECUTES. Operator, 2026-08-27: *"I'm ready for the managed exits
      build, if on the next tick is this, cut it loose, or roll, or whatever
      the management is."* With the rulings: *"Everything tied to the orb
      stays. Even the trailing stop armed at 50% and the tightening after
      100% on the peak. The other variables for the other strategies were
      all good except for the BOS"* and *"We still have the 15% floor & the
      'breach' stops."*
      NEW `decide(record, premium, df_1m, open_records)` -> Intent for the
      records this plan COVERS: RunawayContinuation, GEXPinButterfly, and a
      SweepCreditSpread / TrendCreditSpread vertical while it stands alone
      (a formed condor, a tent, ORB and ADOPTED are NOT covered — the ladder
      and ORB's own path decide those, untouched). Order, and it matters:
        1. THE DECLARED SPEC CONDITIONS, read straight off the record — the
           15% floor / hard stop (`stop_premium`), the BREACH stops (a 1m
           close through `underlying_stop`: the ORB boundary, the bound,
           the pool), the target, the nickel. These are never outranked.
        2. THE CALCULATORS — the exit engine's evaluate() for the 50% trail,
           the tightening after 100% on the peak, theta bleed, velocity
           stall. Its ExitDecision is adopted as the plan's own. BOS is gone
           (exit_engine v4.7).
      Every intent is a ROW before it is an act (CLOSE / TRAIL / HOLD with
      the condition that fired and the numbers). position_manager v4.6 asks
      this plan first and executes its intent through the same
      _execute_exit; the engine's evaluate() runs directly only for records
      the plan does not cover.
v1.0  2026-08-27  r166 — THE MANAGEMENT PLAN: ONE WATCHER PER OPEN POSITION.
      Operator, 2026-08-27, on where stops live: *"The plan seems like the
      right place for them … I like the thought of it watching & thinking if
      it does 'this' or 'this' we're out!"* And on the r66 vectors: *"if there
      is a way to incorporate those vectors back into the management (and
      stop functions) I think that is the logical next step."*

THE SAME SPLIT AS ENTRIES, ONE POSITION AT A TIME.
  · The STRATEGY declares its exit conditions as data (`EXIT_CONDITIONS`
    below, keyed by strategy name) — what "we're out" means for that spec.
  · The MANAGEMENT PLAN reads, every tick for every open record, the current
    value of each of those conditions off what the exit engine already
    tracks (premium now, stop premium, trail stop, target, underlying stop,
    MFE/MAE, ticks held) and writes ONE row: HOLD "if premium <= 0.66 -> out
    (hard stop); if 1m close < 101.00 -> out (structure); trail 1.12 armed;
    MFE +41%". It also records the r66 DERIVED VECTOR for that strategy
    (aggression at the level, tape, VRP, charm …) into strategy_note with
    phase "manage", so a stop can later be FITTED against what the tape was
    doing while the position lived, not just at entry.
  · The EXIT ENGINE executes, exactly as today. This file changes no exit.

⚠️ WRITTEN AFTER manage_open_position, deliberately: the exit engine has just
priced the record and updated trail/MFE. The row says what would take the
position out on the NEXT tick — anticipatory, like the entry plans.

⚠️ NEVER RAISES, NEVER GATES. A bookkeeping failure here cannot reach an exit.

⚠️ CONDITIONS ARE READ, NOT RE-DERIVED. Every threshold below is the record's
own field (set at entry from the strategy's spec) or the exit engine's own
state. When this file and the exit engine disagree, the exit engine is
right and this file has a bug — pinned by tests/check_management_plan.py.
