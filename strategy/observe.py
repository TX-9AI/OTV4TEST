strategy/observe.py  v1.0
THE PLAN ALWAYS LOOKS; THE STRATEGY IS GATED ON THE HOUR (OBS.1).

v1.0  2026-10-05  OTV4TEST r254 (OBS.1). The operator, 2026-10-05 09:34 ET: "I think a better
      way to frame it would be the plan always looks, but the strategies are gated on the
      hour of the day"; 09:36 ET, scope: "A for sure" (Breakout, Runaway and the Hunt only);
      09:32 ET: "Have those blocked TRADES just to Log only". Before this, r187's 10:29 end
      stopped each of the three PLANS too - admission never asked the strategy, and each
      plan returned DORMANT 'entry_window' before it looked - so nothing recorded what the
      cutoff blocked (CUT.1 needs exactly that).

WHAT IT IS. One per-tick set: the strategies admission refused ONLY on its window, after that
window ended and before the entries stop (15:40). main.py publishes it each tick
(`set_active`) and clears it at the top of every dispatch. A strategy in it is ASKED, its plan
runs exactly as in the morning, and anything it would fire is RECORDED, never executed:

  · strategy/plan.py `take()` writes the verdict LOG-ONLY (never TAKE), opens no plan_ledger
    row and reports nothing fired;
  · main.py refuses the signal at `_fire`, at the hunt's own door, and again at the top of
    `_execute_entry_signal` - three locks, so no path reaches sizing, an order or trades.db;
  · the Hunt's in-memory FINISHED set is untouched, so tomorrow's state and the real
    one-per-break rule are exactly as they were.

⚠️ FAILS CLOSED. Empty unless main.py published it THIS tick; an exception anywhere here
reads as "not observing", which leaves every plan's own window check in force - the old
behaviour, never a trade.
