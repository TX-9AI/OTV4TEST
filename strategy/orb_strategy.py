strategy/orb_strategy.py  v4.8
v4.8  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r91 — the signal carries `entry_delta` from
      `contract.delta`, the sizing input the structural stop needs to convert
      |entry - impulsive candle extreme| into premium. Read from the contract,
      never re-derived; the same attribute main.py already writes to the row.
v4.7  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r20 — THE ORB KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT LEVELS. Operator:
      "I want levels taken out of the orb trade entirely — that was to prevent
      fake-outs, but proved ineffective for the task." The same ruling he gave
      mainline at r365. SIX EXCISIONS: the `LiquidityMap` import, the `liq_map`
      parameter, the `_analyze_liquidity` call and the 88-line method, every
      consumer of its result (the pool-in-path note, the named-level confluence
      and the `conviction += 0.15` riding on it, the path-clear and unnamed-
      cluster notes, the target-adjusted note), and `break_level`, whose only
      consumer was that method. 407 lines to 305; pyflakes reports zero
      undefined names and no new warning.
      🔑 MEASURED BEFORE REMOVAL, AND INERT HERE WHERE IT WAS NOT ON MAINLINE.
      There a pool just beyond the TP re-derived the CONTRACT through the global
      strike increment, firing on 10 of 115 ORB trades (8.7%%). Here OTV4TEST r2
      had already moved strike selection into `orb_plan`, so `contract` comes
      from `prep` and no pool has touched it since; Rule 3's target adjustment
      was explicitly RECORDED, NOT APPLIED since r193; and `signal.conviction`
      has NO READER in the decision path (main.py: "DO NOT REINTRODUCE A
      CONVICTION GATE", pinned by tests/check_conviction_removed.py). What
      changes is notes and one log line.
      ⚠️ THE PARAMETER IS REMOVED, NOT IGNORED, so a caller still passing
      `liq_map` raises rather than being silently disregarded — mainline's r365
      found exactly that hiding in a test harness that DRIVES the function while
      three source-shape gates stayed green.
v4.6  2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r2 — THE STRATEGY IS THE SPEC; THE PLAN SELECTS.
      Agreed with the operator part by part on 2026-09-08 (PLAN_SPEC §29).
      `generate_signal()` no longer touches the chain, picks a strike, prices
      a contract or reads ATR: it asks `strategy/orb_plan.py` for this tick's
      preparation and fires ONLY when every declared bar is met, with the
      plan's stop, strike, contract, premium and floor. What moved out:
      `get_chain_fetcher().select_orb_strike(...)` (now `orb_plan.select_contract`,
      parity-pinned), the target/50% arithmetic (the engine's own numbers are
      read, never recomputed), and the plan row (the plan writes it every tick
      from 09:35, both sides priced, so "why did ORB not fire" has an answer
      before the retest rather than after). DELETED BY RULING: the ATR floor
      (`ORB_ATR_FLOOR_PCT`) — "makes no sense" for this setup; ORB has no ATR
      read. The liquidity/VWAP/Fed-day items stay as NOTES on the signal (r193:
      recorded, never gating). New kwargs `now_hhmm` and `offer_working` are
      the two facts only main.py knows. `self.planner` is still the same Plan
      object, now owned by the ORBPlan, so W2 and the board see no change.
v4.5  2026-09-04  r235 — 🔴 THE GATE ASKS "HAS THIS CONFIRMATION
      FIRED", NOT "HAS ANY". `confirmation_spent()` is EXTRACTED to module
      level so the checker drives it rather than a copy (C.23). `>=` not `==`,
      so an out-of-order restore fails SHUT; and the `_c > 0` guard means the
      latch does not depend on the state gate for its correctness.
v4.4  2026-09-01  r207 — ONE CONFIRMATION, ONE ORDER, AND THE GEOMETRY COMES
      FROM THE ENGINE. This file gated on `orb.state` ALONE, so anything
      holding an OPEN_* object fired every tick it was asked. On 2026-09-01
      QQQ took two ORB shorts off one confirmation because main.py held a
      stale ORBData across the manage→entry seam and this gate had nothing
      else to say no with. It now refuses a confirmation whose
      `order_placed` latch is set, which is true in paper and live alike.
      The signal also carries `orb_stop_distance_px` — the boundary-to-wick
      distance frozen at the break — so the sizer stops recomputing it from
      the live price at the entry seam.
v4.3  2026-08-30  r193 — POOL IN PATH IS RECORD-ONLY. A named pool within
      BEYOND_TP_ADJUSTMENT_WIDTHS past the 100% target used to PULL the
      target to that pool. Operator's ruling: record it, do not let it move
      the trade. Detection, the counted clusters and the notes all stay, so
      the effect can be studied later; the target is now the pure measured
      move. ⚠️ The pull was a grading-era survivor that CHANGED WHAT THE
      TRADE DOES while reading like an annotation.
v4.2  2026-08-26  r146 — RECORDED THROUGH THE PLAN, ZERO HURDLES. Operator,
      2026-08-26: *"Include orb in that, zero hurdles."* The three refusals
      this file makes AFTER the engine confirms (no contract, zero premium,
      ATR below the reachable floor) and the fire itself now write a
      plan_tick row through `self.planner` (strategy/plan.py, `record_only`).
      ⚠️ NOTHING GATES. `executable()` is never called on this plan; no R
      hurdle, no geometry, no window is applied to ORB. The 2026-08-25 ruling
      — *"leave orb alone. That one can't get encumbered with extra hurdles"*
      — stands; this is narration of decisions the file already made, so
      "why did ORB not fire this morning" has an answer in the table. The
      engine-state-not-confirmed case is recorded by main.py, which is the
      only place that knows the engine was not asked.
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).


v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/orb_strategy.py — ORB break-and-retest signal generation.
v3.0 — original release
populate orb_range_high/low on signal so exit_engine
        can apply strategy-aware ORB stop logic
update state check for orb_engine v1.1 rename:
        CONFIRMED_LONG/SHORT -> OPEN_LONG/SHORT
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
⬛ SUPERSEDED 2026-09-13 (OTV4TEST r20) — THE THREE RULES BELOW ARE GONE AND
THIS FILE READS NO LEVELS AT ALL. Operator: "I want levels taken out of the orb
trade entirely — that was to prevent fake-outs, but proved ineffective for the
task." Kept, struck, per the r240 precedent: a rule a later ruling contradicts
is a wrong answer rather than history, and this is WHY the ORB looked as it did
for the whole of v3 and v4. Rule 2 was already record-only from r193; Rule 3's
target adjustment was recorded and never applied here; Rule 1's confluence
carried a conviction bump that nothing in the decision path read.
Liquidity-aware ORB logic:
RULE 1 — Named level IS the break level (catalyst, not obstacle):
  If the ORB high/low sits within 0.15% of a named pool (PDH, PDL, session H/L),
  and the break direction is THROUGH that level, this is a high-quality setup.
  The sweep of that level IS the ORB catalyst. Add confluence, don't penalize.
RULE 2 — Named level in path between entry and 50% TP (hard reduce):
  A named pool sitting between entry and the trail-activation level is a known
  reversal zone. Require at least one extra confluence factor, OR block.
RULE 3 — Named level just beyond 100% TP (adjust target, don't block):
  If a named pool sits within 0.5 ORB-widths past the 100% TP, move the target
  to that pool price rather than projecting past it.
v-namelevels (2026-07-28) — the liquidity gate NAMES the levels it blocks on.
        Was: "Named pool in fakeout zone (entry->50%TP): 1 named level(s)." — a bare
        count, unauditable. On 2026-07-28 this gate held the AVGO ORB short for SIX
        consecutive ticks (13:42:15 -> 13:43:30, 90s) starting the same tick the
        retest confirmed; the trade finally filled at 372.11 — 1.4pt below the
        confirmation and 0.5pt off the absolute low — then reversed and stopped out
        (-$135.50). The block never said WHAT it blocked on. Now logs name@price for
        every pool in the fakeout zone plus entry/50%TP/direction, and carries
        named_in_path_detail / unnamed_in_path_detail on the result for callers.
        NOTE: this is OBSERVABILITY ONLY — the gate behaviour is unchanged. What the
        block SHOULD do (skip / trade-to-pool / enter reduced) is still open.
