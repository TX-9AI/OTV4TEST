strategy/orcs_plan.py  v1.6
v1.6  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r229 (EM.2) — THE IMPLIED MOVE IS THE TASTYTRADE PLATFORM'S EXPECTED MOVE (analysis.volatility_measures.expected_move_platform: 60% ATM straddle + 30% first strangle + 10% second), no longer the bare ATM straddle. The operator, 2026-10-03: "Use the one that's built into the tasty trade platform." Measured 10-01/10-02 at 09:45-10:29: 0.87-0.91 of the straddle, so the 1.0x distance floor sits 9-13% nearer; the delta cap is unchanged. The straddle is still recorded (atm_straddle).
v1.5  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r223 (EM.1) — mark_of and implied_move are analysis.volatility_measures.quote_mark / straddle_same_strike (moved verbatim; the names here are aliases).
v1.4  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r220 (TIME.1) — its private HH:MM parser is utils.time_utils.parse_hm (eight plans carried the same copy), and an UNREADABLE clock is DORMANT - no trade - instead of skipping the window check.
v1.3  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r207 (PREM.4) — THE WING IS A DOLLAR WIDTH (ORCS_WING_USD), not 1% of spot. The operator: "why the
      fuck would I risk $1000 for $25???" - the 1% wing was my harness's constant, never varied, and it made
      the credit 4% of the risk. The long is the listed strike nearest ORCS_WING_USD beyond the short. The
      delta cap and the implied-move floor are config's (0.20 and 1.0 as of r207).
v1.2  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r206 (PREM.3) — THE ENTRY LADDER GOVERNS THE ENTRY; THE PLAN'S OWN OFFER IS REMOVED.
      The operator, 2026-10-03, on r204's "freezes an offer one cent better than the mark": "No, we have a
      ladder for entries. THAT has to govern our entry. 'One cent better' is not even a valid increment
      on most contracts". REMOVED: the frozen offer, its limit (mark + ORCS_LIMIT_IMPROVE), the ten-minute
      rest (ORCS_REST_MIN), the offer_* checks, the restart read of them, and the last-offer cutoff. NOW:
      a side whose gates pass is READY at the MARK credit and the strategy hands it to the house credit
      entry (_execute_condor_leg): paper books the mark through limit_ladder.paper_fill_credit; live
      walks the entry ladder down from the best credit and stops at the mark, on valid increments. A
      side already entered this session (the strategy reads trades.db) is recorded `taken`, not ready.
      EVERYTHING BELOW ABOUT AN "OFFER" DESCRIBES r203/r204 AND IS NO LONGER TRUE.
v1.1  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r204 (PREM.2) — THE OPENING RANGE CREDIT SPREAD (ORCS): THE PLAN NOW FEEDS A TRADE.
      The operator, 2026-10-03: "No, keep going. I want to paper trade it Monday. Retire the sweep & TCS.
      Call this new one the opening range credit spread ORCS." Renamed from open_premium_plan.py (r203);
      the plan name is OpeningRangeCreditSpread and the dials are ORCS_*. WHAT CHANGED IN THE PLAN:
      (1) `prep.fills` names the sides whose frozen offer FILLED ON THIS TICK (the mark reached the
      limit) - the strategy trades exactly those, at the limit; (2) a new offer is frozen only while a
      full rest still fits inside the window (the last offer is at END minus ORCS_REST_MIN), so every
      offer resolves inside the admission window; (3) the window comes from config.ENTRY_WINDOWS;
      (4) the plan's row is TAKE on a fill tick. Location, pricing, gates and the restart read are r203's.
v1.0  2026-10-03  OTV4TEST r203 (PREM.1) — THE OPENING PREMIUM SPREAD PLAN, RECORD-ONLY (PLAN_SPEC §41).
      The operator, 2026-10-03: "Build this spec, use it to draft the strategy's trigger components
      Incorporating derivative informers if it enhances the edge further. After the trigger components
      are selected, set preliminary dials, then build the plan that searches the chain for our trigger
      components' location on the chain." And on fills: "we get better than mark or we don't trade it."

      THE TRADE: on a 0DTE session, from 09:45 ET, sell one put spread and one call spread far out of
      the money and hold them to the close. The studies behind it (X5-X8, /var/tmp/levels_1003/
      RESULT.md): QQQ 0DTE, 28 priced sessions, short strike at |delta| <= 0.15 entered 09:45, mid
      fills - 96% winners, R +0.036 / +0.029 by half. NOT PROVEN: those 28 sessions were calm.

      WHAT IT SEARCHES THE CHAIN FOR, each side, every tick of the window:
        the SHORT strike - the nearest-to-spot OTM strike whose |delta| <= ORCS_SHORT_DELTA_MAX and
          whose distance from spot is >= ORCS_MIN_IM_MULT x the implied move (the ATM straddle's mark);
        the LONG strike  - the listed strike nearest ORCS_WING_PCT of spot further out;
        the CREDIT at the mark, and the same credit at bid/ask (recorded beside it);
        the OFFER - a limit ORCS_LIMIT_IMPROVE better than the mark, frozen at the first ready tick and
          watched for ORCS_REST_MIN minutes: filled_mark when the frozen spread's mark reaches the limit,
          filled_natural when its bid/ask does. Unfilled at the end = NO TRADE (the ruling above).
      DAY GATES: the chain expires today (0DTE); |overnight gap| <= ORCS_MAX_GAP_PCT (the one informer
      that agreed on both samples - large-gap days paid out more on the 56-day sample).
      RECORDED, GATING NOTHING: implied move, opening-range width, VIX, each short's distance.

      The frozen offer is re-read from this plan's own rows at the first look, so a restart inside the
      window continues the offer instead of re-freezing it (nothing lives only in memory).
