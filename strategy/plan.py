"""
strategy/plan.py  v1.9
v1.9  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r6 (HYG.4) — `_ledger_open` returns when a store is BOUND
      (tests): the box's plan_ledger carried TestStrat rows written by the
      lander's checks. A bound store means "not the box".
v1.8  2026-09-03  r231 — `PlanTick.level()` takes `spot` and passes it to
      `classify()`, which now requires it. Geometry asks role-vs-PRICE as well
      as role-vs-range (operator, 2026-09-03), and a level price has already
      traversed is invalidated. Required, not optional: an optional parameter
      is an invalidation a caller can omit without anything saying so.
v1.7  2026-09-01  r213 (chunk E) — EVERY SKIP NAMES ITSELF. Operator,
      2026-09-01: *"I don't like 'NOT ASKED' as a reason. It makes no sense.
      Not asked? why or Why not?"*
      🔴 THE CAUSE WAS A GAP, NOT WORDING. `CondorManagement`, `CreditRoll`
      and every `<Strategy>/manage` row are driven ONLY from main.py's
      `has_open_position()` branch, and no skip site named them — so on a flat
      box they fell to the default on every tick of every session. The other
      half of that same branch already said the reverse out loud ("position
      open — managing; only the second-leg window asks the credit
      strategies"): one direction had a sentence, the other did not.
      ⚠️ AND A `/manage` ENTRY OUTLIVES ITS POSITION — REGISTRY persists for
      the life of the process, so once a strategy has managed anything its row
      keeps reporting for the rest of the day.
      · `skipped_management(reason)` names them all, by REGISTRATION rather
        than by a name list in another file — r35's allow-list rot, where the
        list held three names, two of which had been deleted, while the live
        strategy was silently exempt.
      · `setdefault`, not assignment: a plan already skipped for a specific
        cause keeps that cause.
      🔑 AND THE FALLBACK ADMITS WHAT IT IS. It fires only where main.py named
      nothing, so it now reads as a DISPATCH GAP rather than a market
      condition — r73 one level up: a refusal that cannot say which rung
      refused it is worse than no refusal, because it gets trusted anyway.
v1.6
v1.6  2026-09-01  r212 (chunk D) — `_ledger_open` SUPERSEDES THE PREVIOUS
      UNFILLED PLAN of the same strategy before opening a new one. A plan that
      FIRES and is then refused downstream (sizing rejection, no priced
      contract, a failed order) links no trade, so the exit-side close can
      never reach it and it stayed live all session. Safe here because `take()`
      and the entry attempt happen on the SAME tick.
      ⚠️ ROWS THAT FILLED ARE UNTOUCHED — those close on their exit. See
      derived/plan_ledger.py v4.1.
v1.5
v1.5  2026-08-29  r177: tick_id (begin_tick's monotonic counter) persisted on
      plan_tick and plan_check — the vector<->plan join becomes BY KEY, not by
      timestamp coincidence, before the first fit. In-place ALTER migration;
      pre-r177 rows read 0, which no join should match.
v1.4  2026-08-27  r165: ensure_tables() guards with a flag on the store, not
      id(store) in a set — recycled ids let a fresh store skip CREATE TABLE
      and every row write failed "no such table" (seen in a test that opens a
      store per call; the same class could bite a store re-opened in-process).
v1.3  2026-08-27  r163: the DailyFork aliases retire with the strategy.
v1.2  2026-08-27  r160: DISPATCH_ALIAS — SweepForLeg2 -> SweepCreditSpread; the
      CondorLeg2 alias retires with the deleted level-selection.
v1.1  2026-08-26  r147: DISPATCH_ALIAS — the second-leg window now has one
      caller (CondorLeg2nd -> the condor's leg-2 plan, name `CondorLeg2`);
      the three retired second-leg aliases are removed.
v1.0  2026-08-26  r146 — THE PLAN, REBUILT AS THE OPERATOR SPECIFIED IT.
      Replaces the seven parallel strategy re-implementations that lived in
      `derived/plans.py` r126-r145 (1,200 lines, zero calls into strategy/).
      The recording layer from that file is carried over intact; the
      decision logic is not, because the STRATEGY is the decision.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT A PLAN IS — operator, 2026-08-26, verbatim
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
*"The strategy is the spec, the specification. The plan is how it executes
according to the spec."* And: *"I don't need two strategies for every
strategy. I need a strategy, which is the specification, and the plan, that
plans on how to execute it and is verbose about every decision it's making
on each tick."*

And the purpose, in his words: the plan says *"if X happens on the next tick,
we are choosing strikes and calculating r-values (risk:reward) and gating on
1:1, but under relaxed entry rules the gate would still record the value but
not veto"* — and it *"deconflicts competing valid strategies by invalidating
levels or strikes on geometry or economics."* *"The spec is how the setup
functions, but the plan exists to account for other emergent factors that
are antagonistic to the strategies' execution."*

    STRATEGY  = the spec. Detects the setup, fixes the trigger and the
                invalidation, names the level, selects the contracts,
                EXECUTES. It is the only decision path.
    PLAN      = the informer the strategy consults. Prices the what-if
                (credit/debit, risk, R), runs the antagonistic checks
                (geometry against the session map, the R hurdle, the
                clock), RECORDS every check every tick, and hands back a
                verdict the strategy honours.

⚠️ THE PLAN NEVER DETECTS A SETUP AND NEVER SELECTS A STRIKE. If it did, it
would be a second implementation of the strategy — the thing that was
delivered by mistake and had to be torn out. The plan is told what the
strategy found and prices THAT.

⚠️ THE PLAN'S VERDICT IS CONSULTED, NOT DECORATIVE. Under STRICT criteria a
plan that cannot clear the R hurdle REFUSES, and the strategy returns None.
Under RELAXED the R value is recorded, the verdict reads MUTED, and the
strategy proceeds — `strategy/criteria.py` owns that switch and this file
only calls it. The old engine could not affect a trade by design and so
measured nothing that mattered.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE SHAPE OF A STRATEGY'S TICK, and every strategy is written this way
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    t = self.planner.tick(price_now, direction=...)
    if <spec gate fails>:            return t.refuse("gate_name", "why")
    if <input missing>:              return t.starved("chain")
    ok = t.level(level_price, role, name, orb_high, orb_low, price_now)  # geometry
    if not ok:                        return t.refuse("geometry", t.last_why)
    t.credit_spread(short_k, long_k, credit, invalidation=...)  # the what-if
    ok, why = t.executable()          # the R hurdle, strict/relaxed aware
    if not ok:                        return t.refuse("r_hurdle", why)
    return t.take(signal)

Every terminal — refuse / starved / take / hold — writes the row for this
strategy on this tick, feeds `analysis/gate_report` (edge-triggered log), and
returns what the strategy should return. So `return t.refuse(...)` IS the
refusal, and a strategy cannot refuse without saying why.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE RECORD — carried over from r126b, the split is the whole design
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  `plan_tick`   THE SPINE. One row per strategy per tick: verdict, reason,
                trigger, invalidation, spot, distance to trigger, R.
                Shared columns, because comparing R ACROSS strategies at one
                instant is the point.
  `plan_check`  LONG FORMAT. One row per variable per strategy per tick, with
                its own PASS/FAIL, so an elimination is a queryable row.
                A check that could not be measured is written NULL / n/a —
                NEVER 0.0/PASS (the VW.1 lesson; pinned by check_plan_wiring).

VERDICTS: TAKE · DECLINE · NO PLAN (input starved) · NOT ASKED (the
dispatch never called this strategy this tick — recorded by the board with
the dispatcher's reason) · HOLD / ROLL / CLOSE (management).
A TAKE under a muted R hurdle is still a TAKE — it was taken — and carries
the `r_muted` check PASS and a reason beginning "R hurdle MUTED (relaxed)",
so the relaxed population is separable by query, never by guess.

⚠️ ONE ROW PER STRATEGY PER TICK, ALWAYS. The board (`derived/plans.py`)
closes each tick: any registered strategy that wrote nothing gets a NOT ASKED
row carrying the reason main.py gave, or, if the strategy WAS asked and
still wrote nothing, a row saying so — that row is the canary for an
unwired `return None`.

⚠️ WRITES NEVER RAISE. A bookkeeping failure cannot change a verdict; the
verdict is computed first and the write is wrapped.
