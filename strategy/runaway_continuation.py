strategy/runaway_continuation.py  v4.8
v4.8  2026-09-08  r321 — DOCTRINE HEADER CORRECTED, NO BEHAVIOUR CHANGE. The
      GATE CATEGORIES block still read *"SELECTION — relaxed. cutoff 11:30 ->
      14:00"*, which r176 removed on 2026-08-29. Code and `criteria.py` were
      right; the header was stale, and §32 makes that header the thing an
      editor reads before touching the file — so it was advertising exactly the
      afternoon extension the operator had forbidden. Also states plainly what
      IS relaxed here: the R hurdle, muted, and nothing else.
v4.7  2026-08-29  r176: the 11:30 debit cutoff no longer relaxes to 14:00
      (operator: "Debit entries are finished at 1130, period … We are
      burning theta"). Also removes the afternoon slot starvation the
      extension caused — after 11:30 the dispatch slot is the credit book's.
v4.6  2026-08-28  r174 — TWO STRUCTURAL GATES, BOTH FROM THE MORNING'S TAPE
      (operator: "Yes to both, even on relaxed"):
      (1) THE FLOOR MUST CLEAR THE SPREAD. 20% of a $0.15 teenie is three
      cents — inside its own bid/ask, so the "stop" was a coin flip that
      gapped to -27%/-35%, and gain-per-dollar crowned exactly those
      contracts at the band's far edge (AMZN 270C x63 @ $0.17, GOOGL 352.5C
      x77 @ $0.14, every one dead in minutes). gamma_leverage_pick now
      REFUSES any contract whose floor (RUNAWAY_MAX_LOSS_PCT x premium) does
      not exceed its own bid/ask spread; no candidate clears -> structural
      DECLINE naming it. No new knob — the spread is the tape's own number.
      (2) ONE RUNAWAY PER BREAK. A floor stop-out FINISHES that ORB break
      for the session (same doctrine as a credit level finishing on a
      stop): trade_logger's losing-exit hook calls finish_break(); prepare
      refuses a finished (direction, boundary). A NEW break at a new
      boundary is a new trade. In-process registry; a service restart
      clears it, which is acceptable and recorded here. Both gates are
      STRUCTURAL — relaxed does not waive either.
v4.5  2026-08-27  r168 — THE RUNAWAY HAS NO UNDERLYING STOP. Operator,
      2026-08-27: *"the orb structure stop only applies to the orb. The
      runaway stop is the orb boundary — but I think that's a terrible stop
      location. I would prefer (since it's a debit), a decay or adverse
      movement amounting to a 20% loss … The runaway needs room to breathe.
      A few pullbacks in an uptrend are ok."* The floor is a 20% PREMIUM
      loss (RUNAWAY_MAX_LOSS_PCT, via signal.stop_loss_pct -> the record's
      immutable stop_premium); `underlying_stop` is NOT set, so neither the
      management plan's breach check nor the engine's structure stop can
      fire on price. r146-r167 had carried the ORB boundary as the
      invalidation — the rule the operator just retired. The plan's R now
      prices the RISK as that 20% of premium against the modelled gain over
      the run; the ORB boundary remains the origin the run is measured from.
v4.4  2026-08-27  r165 — THE PLAN PREPARES, GAMMA DOES THE HEAVY LIFTING, THE
      STRATEGY BUYS. Operator, 2026-08-27: *"the symbol did not even
      entertain coming back for a retest, it just broke out & ran. We want in
      on the move, but it needs to be over quickly … purchase and wait for
      our trailing stop"* and *"Make gamma do the heavy lifting. Try to get
      just enough OTM to really leverage gamma based on the intensity of the
      move."* `prepare()` is the plan (the sweep's v4.6 shape): dormant past
      the cutoff; each declared CONDITION with its reading (ATR reachable,
      ORB broken with a direction, 1m close beyond the 50% TP and holding);
      the contract SELECTED by `gamma_leverage_pick` — over the run price has
      already made from the ORB boundary (the move's intensity, mirrored as
      the expected continuation), every liquid OTM contract's modelled gain
      δ·run + ½γ·run² per dollar of premium, the highest leverage among
      strikes reachable within the run, else the first OTM. The delta-band
      selector (DELTA_NEAR/DEEP by ATR) is retired for selection; ATR keeps
      its one job — the reachability floor. The R hurdle stays muteable here
      (a debit, no wing to search): strict vetoes, relaxed records.
      `generate_signal()` buys the prepared contract and touches no chain.
      Stops are not encoded in this revision by the operator's instruction.
v4.3  2026-08-27  r148/r149 (RECORDED RETROACTIVELY in r165): two field-name
      defects in r146's wiring fixed — `break_direction` for the handoff
      after the engine invalidates on "runaway", and `target_50pct` (the only
      name that exists; `tp50` printed "50% TP n/a" for a session).
v4.2  2026-08-26  r146 — THE PLAN IS WIRED, AND THE SIGNAL CAN NOW TRADE.
      (1) Every refusal goes through `self.plan` (strategy/plan.py): four
      bare `return None`s that logged nothing — window, price, ATR floor,
      ORB direction, the runaway itself — now write a DECLINE row naming
      the gate. This strategy had ZERO `_gate()` call sites (handoff table).
      (2) 🔴 P0 — THE SIGNAL WAS ALWAYS INVALID. `target_delta` was written
      here and READ NOWHERE (`grep target_delta` — one writer, zero readers,
      the r97 sweep defect exactly). The signal carried no strike, premium or
      contract, so `OptionsSignal.is_valid`'s single-leg arm (`strike > 0 and
      entry_premium > 0`) was False on every fire and main.py logged
      `Invalid signal from RunawayContinuation` and returned. The flagship v4
      entry rule could never place a trade. The contract is now resolved
      HERE against the chain the dispatcher already passes, by the existing
      delta-nearest selector, and the plan prices the what-if off that real
      contract: stop = the ORB boundary, target = the stop distance
      mirrored, R from delta/gamma over those distances.
      (3) The R hurdle is consulted: STRICT refuses below the floor, RELAXED
      records and proceeds (strategy/criteria.py owns the switch).
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Runaway-ORB continuation: the ORB ran to its 50% TP and HELD. Buy the direction
that already proved itself.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Built at the OTV4 split. The FIRST v4 entry rule.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires this block be read before the file is edited.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE PREMISE, AND WHY IT DOES NOT PREDICT DIRECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Four independent searches failed to find a directional predictor in this data:
entry-time conditions (all ambient - pre-filtered by the strategies' own gates),
recorded columns (gates or empty), opening-candle bias (a coin, forward-only,
797 sessions), and the tape harness (every surviving condition helped UP *and*
DOWN - they predict MOVEMENT, not DIRECTION). The live book agreed: **44.9%
direction accuracy on 715 trades, 95% CI [41.3%, 48.6%] - worse than a coin.**

**So this rule does not predict a direction. It observes one that has already
proven itself.** The ORB broke, ran the full 50% TP distance, and HELD there.
The move is not a forecast; it is in evidence. That is the same reason ORB
itself is the one v3 strategy with a positive record - break-and-retest geometry
is self-validating and consults no label.

whole point of v4.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
EVERY THRESHOLD BELOW WAS MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**ATR GATE - the hardest rule here.** `tests/magnitude_estimator.py`, 52,949
bars over 28 dates, scored against the required move from
`tests/chain_feasibility.py` (110,162 contract observations, round-trip spread
included):

    ATR%        0.20-0.35 delta reachable within 90 bars
    < 0.03           0%      <- 2,200 bars, not one reached it
    0.03-0.05        1%
    0.05-0.08       11%
    0.08-0.12       30%
    0.12-0.20       60%
    > 0.20          92%

⚠️ **BELOW 0.05% ATR NO STRIKE IS REACHABLE AT ALL.** The move needed to clear
the spread does not occur - not rarely, NOT AT ALL across 5,517 bars. A long
directional trade in that tape cannot pay no matter how good the entry is, and
this is the likeliest explanation for v3's finding that **82% of
directionally-CORRECT continuation entries never reached +25% MFE.** They were
fired into tape that could not pay them.

**ADX IS NOT USED, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT.** Every ADX band from 0-15 to
40-100 produced the SAME median excursion (0.69%-0.74%) and identical strike
reachability. **ADX 45 reaches no further than ADX 12.** It failed as a
direction predictor AND as a magnitude predictor. ATR is monotone across the
same bars - 0.19% -> 0.28% -> 0.43% -> 0.60% -> 1.07%, a 5.6x spread.

**EXIT IS THE TRAILING STOP. BOS IS NOT USED**, and that is measured too:
    orb_trail_stop      85 trades   96% win   +$30,696   worst  -$16
    bos_exit           217 trades   34% win    -$7,085   worst -$735
BOS carries the single largest loss in the v3 book. The trail's worst case
across 85 trades is sixteen dollars.

⚠️ AND THE FLOOR IS WHERE THE MONEY WENT. ORB's `hard_stop_` - 15 trades,
**-$8,757** - is nearly a third of the trail's gains, lost on trades where the
trail NEVER ENGAGED. Fleet-wide `max_loss_floor` was 76 trades and -$28,179.
**Trails make money; floors lose it.** Anything that delays the trail arming is
a defect, not a conservatism.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GATE CATEGORIES — required by WA §36. Only SELECTION is ever relaxed.
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**FOUNDATIONAL — never relaxed.**
  · the ORB ran to its 50% TP and **HELD** it - a 1m CLOSE beyond, still on the
    right side at the next tick. **This is the entire premise: the move is in
    EVIDENCE, not forecast.** Without it there is no runaway, only an ORB and a
    guess - and a guess is what four independent searches found no basis for.
  · direction comes from the ORB state, never from a prediction.

**SELECTION — and NOTHING here relaxes.**
  · the 11:30 cutoff is the only SELECTION gate this strategy has, and r176
    removed its relaxation. Operator, 2026-08-29: *"Debit entries are finished
    at 1130, period. Do not extend it for relaxed. We are burning theta."*
    🔴 THIS BLOCK SAID `cutoff 11:30 -> 14:00` UNTIL r321 — r176 changed the
    code and the criteria table and left the doctrine header describing the
    behaviour it had just removed, so the one document §32 requires an editor
    to read first was telling them the debit window extends to 14:00.
  · **THE ONLY THING RELAXED CHANGES ON THIS TRADE IS THE R HURDLE**, which is
    MUTED: `r_verdict` records the value and does not gate. Everything else —
    trigger, direction, ATR floor, the ATR→delta map, and both r174 teenie
    gates — is identical in both modes.

**FEASIBILITY — never relaxed.**
  · the ATR floor. Below **0.05% ATR the required move was reached on 0% of
    5,517 measured bars** - not rarely, not once. A trade fired there cannot pay
    regardless of entry quality, teaches nothing about stops, and only adds
    noise to the log the relaxed mode exists to read.
  · the ATR->delta map itself. A strike the tape cannot reach is not a cheaper
    trade, it is a lottery ticket.

    back for the retest, so leaving the retest armed would leave a second
    position waiting for a pullback the tape has already declined to give.
