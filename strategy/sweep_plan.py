strategy/sweep_plan.py  v1.11
v1.11 2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r113 - NO DEPTH GRADING (LVL.15 step 3, the sweep). The
      pierce floor (MIN_REJECTION_PCT, "a touch, not a sweep") and the relaxed
      ceiling (MAX_REJECTION_PCT) no longer refuse: the operator's definition
      of HELD has no depth, and step 3 was approved ("agree on all"). The floor
      was this box's most common sweep refusal (315 rows, 8 sessions); the
      ceiling never refused. The pierce is still RECORDED on every row.
v1.10 2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r106 - THE REJECTION FRESHNESS GATE IS GONE.
      Operator: "I'm done with rejection fresh bars, get rid of it altogether."
      A REJECTED older than REJECTION_FRESH_BARS left `chosen` unset, so the
      trade silently never fired - the LAST place any age decided anything,
      contradicting the ruling that age exists to ORDER the levels by recency
      and is "not relevant to anything else". PLAN_SPEC 31.1 has said it since
      the fork began: "Age does not matter. A previously held extreme is
      enough." The constant and its config key are removed; the age is still
      RECORDED, verdict None, gating nothing. Re-fire is still prevented by
      `_fired_events` on (level_id, bar_ts) - the clock never was what stopped
      a repeat.
v1.9  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r104 - `levels_in_play` now ranks through the
      SHARED `rails_after_held` rather than its own copy. Three copies of
      "rails last" is three chances to drift, which is how three plans ended
      up with three private compositions before r33.
v1.8  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r103 - THE HELD EXTREMES CLAIM THEIR SLOTS AND
      THE RAILS JOIN AFTER. `levels_in_play()` extracted so a checker drives the
      real composition. r33 wrote `levels = levels + tines` one line above the
      cap, in the revision titled "THE FORK BESIDE IT AS AN OR LEVEL", so a
      nearer rail evicted the furthest-out held extreme. Also records the rail
      projection, which was computed every tick and discarded here.
v1.7  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r102 - THE RECORD-ONLY TELEMETRY THIS FILE'S OWN
      HEADER HAS PROMISED SINCE r5, RESTORED. mainline r233 added pierce_pts,
      level_dist_pts and level_dist_pct record-only; r5 rewrote the sweep into
      this file and carried the PARAGRAPH forward WITHOUT the CODE, so the
      header documented telemetry that did not exist and SWEEP.10 was
      unanswerable. Ported from r233 rather than reinvented. Also carries
      `age_bars` on the preparation - computed every tick since r5 and thrown
      away at the end of the function.
v1.6  2026-09-17  OTV4TEST r33 — THE PRIVATE MAP IS GONE; THIS PLAN READS THE ONE
      BOARD. It called `live_levels()`, ran its OWN `level_map.walk()` over the
      result, and then APPENDED the fork's rails into the same list — so a moving
      1h rail and a held session extreme arrived as one indistinguishable
      product. r19 stopped the rails reaching the ledger; this rebuilt the
      conjunction one layer up, in memory, at read time. Now: `board(price)` —
      no ORB bounds, so the walk is from SPOT — with levels in `above`/`below`
      and the rails returned SEPARATELY in `tines`. The rails stay IN PLAY for
      this plan (r5: "3 named up, 3 named down, plus the 1h pitchfork's tines")
      and the operator's 2026-09-17 ruling that the fork is an **OR** level, not
      an AND: one of the mapped levels OR a fork rail. What changed is that they
      arrive LABELLED, so nothing is silently conjoined, and `fork == "absent"`
      is an answer rather than a gap. Levels in play are unchanged in meaning
      and in count.
v1.5  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r29 — the levels in play are WALKED (derived/level_map.walk):
      the newest held level each side of price, older ones only if further out —
      the same map the hunt's board reads, so the plans parse one set of levels
      (mainline PLAN_SPEC §38). The rails are added after the walk, unchanged.
v1.4  2026-09-12  OTV4TEST r15 — the rails come from `tines_now` (never a stored row); the
      PDH/PDL ladder is visible now that pools are classified by side (levels v4.3).
v1.3  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r12 — anchors on the chosen structure (record only): GEX at the
      level, OI at the short, aggressor share at the level, charm at the short, nearest tine.
v1.2  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r11 — `complement_richness`: as a condor's second leg the
      structure must be at least as rich as leg one, or it is REJECTED by name.
v1.1  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r10 — `LAST_PREP`: the most recent preparation, so the
      condor's management plan can name the complement it is waiting on.
v1.0  2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r5 — THE SWEEP CREDIT SPREAD PLAN (PLAN_SPEC §31),
      agreed with the operator 2026-09-08/09. The thesis: a previously held
      extreme is swept and rejected; THE LEVEL HOLDS TO THE CLOSE. Sell a
      credit vertical against it, near the money, while it is rich.

      LEVELS IN PLAY — read from the derived level store (`live_levels`),
      never from a private map: the 3 nearest live named levels ABOVE spot
      (resistances) and the 3 nearest BELOW (supports), plus the 1h fork's
      tines (in the store since derived/levels v4.2, keyed on the tine, the
      tine rule applied there). Nothing inside the opening range exists (the
      store retired it TRAVERSED). The geometry gate (session_map.classify)
      still runs per level.

      BOTH SIDES PREPARED EVERY TICK FROM 09:35 — for every level in play the
      structure it WOULD sell if rejected: short strike = the first listed
      strike at/beyond THE LEVEL (the held extreme — operator's ruling, not the
      wick's extreme; a deep pierce is a weak level, so the cushion was
      protecting the trades least worth taking), wing searched with
      `credit_vertical.search_wing` against R_FLOOR on bid/ask, credit, width,
      R, and RICHNESS = credit / width recorded as a dial. The row carries the
      nearest candidate each side: "nearest above: PDH 712.40 — would sell
      713/718C for 0.85 (R 1.10, 17% of width) — waiting on: REJECTED".

      THE TRIGGER IS THE FACT. `DerivedStore.latest_rejection()` — a REJECTED
      event on a level in play, on the trade's side of spot, ~~FRESH (within
      REJECTION_FRESH_BARS of its bar)~~ — STRUCK at r106, the operator: "I'm
      done with rejection fresh bars, get rid of it altogether", superseding
      "it has to decide quickly"; the age is recorded and gates nothing, and
      a level does not stop being a swept held extreme because a clock ran.
      Struck rather than deleted, per §35 — pierce depth inside the band (MIN/MAX_REJECTION_PCT, the
      relaxed x3 ceiling as before), each event fired at most once. On a
      shallow pierce that is the wicking bar's own close; on a deep one, the
      next. Nothing is computed at the fire that was not on the row the tick
      before.

      THE BARS the strategy reads (PLAN_SPEC §31.2): window 09:35–14:00 ·
      REJECTED on a level in play · level not spent · price on the profitable
      side · ATR <= ATR_MAX_PCT (FEASIBLE) · the wing clears R_FLOOR
      (ECONOMICAL) · geometry. Sizing is the env default for verticals.
      The condor complement (`required_side`, `_can_open_credit_spread`) is
      untouched — the sweep may still form the other side of a condor; its
      spec comes last.

      OUTSIDE THE WINDOW THE PLAN OBSERVES AND DOES NOT WRITE (dormant).

    """r103 — THE HELD EXTREMES CLAIM THEIR SLOTS FIRST; THE RAILS JOIN AFTER.

    Returns (above, below, held_above, held_below).

    🔴 THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO STOP, AND r33 WROTE IT ITSELF. r33's own title
    is "THE FORK BESIDE IT AS AN OR LEVEL" and its docstring says the rails sit
    "BESIDE the levels, never hidden in them" — and the same revision added
    `levels = levels + tines` one line before the `[:limit]` slice. So a rail
    nearer to spot took one of the three slots and the furthest-out held extreme
    fell off the board. `board()` forbids exactly this: "THE FORK IS A SECOND
    PRODUCT, NOT A LEVEL IN THIS LIST ... NEVER merged into above/below (r19:
    co-inform, do not conjoin)".

    🔑 r15, r19 AND r33 ALL SETTLED THIS AT THE PRODUCER AND GATED THE PRODUCER.
    `board()` has been correct since r19. Nothing checked what a CONSUMER did
    with its output, so the conjunction was rebuilt one layer up, at read time,
    and every gate stayed green (§23 — fix every reader, not just the writer).
    EXTRACTED so the checker drives THIS function rather than a paraphrase of it.

    🔑 WHY THEY ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THING, operator 2026-09-22: "The
    pitchfork is a co-informer and does not live in the liquidity level levels
    ... since it's a slope over time, it's a moving target it has to be a
    separate artifact", and "It's not a LIQUIDITY level. It's just a respected
    level." A held extreme is a fixed price that printed on a bar, with resting
    stops beyond it — that pool is what a sweep RAIDS. A rail is a diagonal that
    moves every bar and holds no pool. Ranking them together by distance
    compares two different quantities.

    ⚠️ THE RAILS REMAIN SELLABLE, BY RULING. r5 ("3 named up, 3 named down,
    PLUS the 1h pitchfork's tines"), r33 ("an OR level not an AND — one of the
    mapped levels or a fork rail"), and the operator on 2026-09-22 asked
    directly whether they should be dropped from this plan entirely: "The sweep
    still works with the pitchfork, because the channel is respected." A
    rejection off a respected rail is a real event even though no stops were
    taken there. PLUS, not competing — that is the whole of the change.

    ⚠️ `limit` CAPS THE HELD EXTREMES ONLY, and is a PREFERENCE rather than a
    bound — operator: "Three would be ideal ... if there's more I would like to
    have more, if there's less we can accept that too." Fewer than `limit` is an
    answer, never padded.
