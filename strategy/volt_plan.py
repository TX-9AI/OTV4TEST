strategy/volt_plan.py  v1.2
v1.2  2026-09-24  OTV4TEST r131 — DOCSTRING ONLY. The operator, 2026-09-24:
      *"VOLT needs to adopt the breakout sizing model."* The ORDER is now sized
      by RiskManager's geometry/risk rule (main._geometry_inputs, fed
      `sizing_distance = risk_px` by volt_strategy). `provisional_size` below
      is unchanged and is now only the plan's FEASIBILITY bar (does one
      contract fit VOLT_BUDGET_USD), not the size that is placed.
v1.1  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r74 — THE ENTRY FRAME DROPS TO ONE MINUTE AND THE
      WARM-UP TO THREE BARS. v1.0 gated on COMPLETED 5-MINUTE bars and demanded
      eight of them — 40 minutes — so a window opening at 09:35 could not fire
      before 10:15, measured at NEVER in the first 40 minutes across 18
      sessions. The operator: *"It should be able to fire immediately. I want
      to move on the first sense that volume is expanding and It needs to jump
      on."* Measured after: 24.2 trades/session against 2.0, first fire 09:37.
      ⚠️ THE EXIT FRAME IS UNCHANGED at five minutes — his stop ruling. Entry
      and exit frames are independent, and conflating them is what made the
      window unreachable.
v1.0  2026-09-20  OTV4TEST r72 — VOLT (VOLume Trade). THE CONTROL ARM.

🔑 WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS NOT AN EDGE CLAIM.
The operator, 2026-09-20, after a full day of tape study returned almost
nothing: *"How hard would it be to construct 1 more trade strategy & plan… as
a control group. To study something… Nothing more complicated, since
absolutely ZERO indicators would help inform our trades, apparently."*

VOLT is the NULL HYPOTHESIS MADE TRADEABLE. It gates on TWO things — a
direction read and rising volume — and nothing else. No ADX, no regime, no
level map, no R floor, no freshness prior, no pin, no gamma. If VOLT performs
comparably to the gated strategies on the same tape in the same window, then
the gates are decoration and that is the single most valuable thing this fork
could learn. If VOLT is materially worse, the gates are earning their keep and
we can say so with a measurement instead of a belief.

⚠️ IT MUST NOT COMPETE. Registered blocking nothing and blocked by nothing,
same window as ORB/RUNAWAY/HUNT/BREAKOUT (09:35-11:30), so all five see the
same setups and the losing arm's outcome stays OBSERVABLE. That is r51's
ruling, in the operator's words: *"letting them all go at the same time is
gonna allow us to get the differentiation needed to rule on them later."*
Under a cascade the comparison is impossible.

THE TWO GATES, AND WHERE THEIR NUMBERS CAME FROM.
Both were MEASURED on 247 symbol-sessions of 15-second tape (13 names x 19
sessions, 2026-08-24..09-18) rather than chosen. The measurement asked one
question: from a signal bar, does price reach +0.5 ATR before -1.0 ATR within
30 minutes? That geometry breaks even at 66.7%.

  DIRECTION = close vs the SESSION OPEN. Four reads were tested at three
  volume thresholds (12 cells, all reported, none hidden):
      read              1.25x     1.5x     2.0x
      bar close>open    64.8%    62.8%    66.7%
      close vs EMA20    65.6%    63.1%    68.6%
      2 closes trend    63.3%    61.4%    65.8%
      vs SESSION OPEN   68.8%    66.7%    72.0%   <- best at EVERY threshold
  🔑 IT WINS AT ALL THREE, which is the argument — not the margin. And it is
  the SIMPLEST read available: one comparison, zero parameters, nothing to
  fit. For a control those are the same virtue.

  VOLUME = the 5m bar >= 1.25x the mean of the trailing five completed 1m bars.
  1.25x fires on ~9% of in-window bars (n=445 of the measured sample), which
  is what gives the control enough trades to be measurable at all. 2.0x reads
  higher (72.0%) on n=50 and 3.0x produced n=2 — too rare to study.

⚠️ THE HONEST LIMIT ON BOTH NUMBERS, STATED HERE SO IT IS NOT REDISCOVERED:
the winning cell was picked from 12, so +2.1pp over breakeven is INSIDE the
noise a 12-cell search generates. The cross-threshold consistency is the only
real evidence. And the study measured the UNDERLYING with an ATR target/stop
while VOLT trades an OPTION against a STRUCTURE stop, so it INDICATES the
direction read; it does not translate to VOLT's P&L. Both are DECLARED PRIORS
(WA §31), recorded on every row, and neither has been proven on a trade.

THE STOP IS THE ENTRY — the operator's ruling, 2026-09-21: *"Use a structural
stop. A close beyond where the trade opened is a dead thesis."* A 1m close back
through the entry price ends it. No lookback, no extreme, no fitted number, and
no way for the stop distance to degenerate toward zero (which is exactly what
killed the two designs that preceded it — see the ruling block below).

THE TRAIL ARMS ON DISTANCE, NOT PREMIUM — at 0.5R where R = |entry - stop|,
the operator's spec verbatim. Once armed the floor is
`entry + L x (peak - entry)`, r44's shape, because the OLD trail floor was a
fraction of PREMIUM and could sit BELOW ENTRY: at a +20% arm an 80% lock
floors at 0.96 of entry, so arming the trail could GUARANTEE a loss. The
`entry + L x (peak - entry)` form is >= entry by construction.
