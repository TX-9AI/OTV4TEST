strategy/volt_strategy.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-24  OTV4TEST r131 — THE SIGNAL CARRIES `sizing_distance = risk_px`.
      The operator, 2026-09-24: *"VOLT needs to adopt the breakout sizing
      model."* main._geometry_inputs sizes any signal carrying it on
      RiskManager._size_geometry (ORB_RISK_USD / ORB_BUDGET_USD, the r93 noise
      floor on this distance) instead of the budget rule. NOT entry - stop:
      VOLT's stop IS its entry, so that distance is 0 by design. NOT the
      `sizes_on_geometry` flag: that is also sizes_on_structure(), which moves
      the trail activation — an exit change nobody ruled. Trigger, stop,
      ENT.1 opt-out and exits unchanged.
      OPTION 2 (operator, same day): also carries `sizing_delta` (the chosen
      contract's delta) so the sizer prices VOLT's 1-R as |delta| x range,
      Breakout's curve, not the flat 25% floor. Sizing only.
v1.0  2026-09-20  OTV4TEST r72 — VOLT, THE CONTROL ARM'S SPEC.

THE SPEC IS FOUR BARS AND A FIRE. Everything that searches, selects or sizes
lives in `strategy/volt_plan.py` (PLAN_SPEC §10). This module declares what
must be true when price arrives and builds the signal — no chain, no strike
arithmetic, no thresholds of its own.

🔑 WHAT MAKES IT A CONTROL — read this before adding anything.
Its whole value is the SHORTNESS of the gate list. The moment VOLT acquires a
third gate it stops answering the question it was built for, which is whether
the gated strategies' gates are worth their cost. If a condition looks like it
belongs here, it belongs in a NEW strategy, not in this one.

⚠️ NO CONVICTION, NO CONFLUENCE SCORING, NO GRADE. `conviction` has no reader
in the decision path (pinned by tests/check_conviction_removed.py) and a
`setup_grade` is exactly the kind of thing whose absence is being measured.

NOTHING HERE IS AN EDGE CLAIM. VOLT is expected to be roughly break-even at
best — the direction read measured 68.8% against a 66.7% breakeven on a
0.5:1.0 geometry, and that margin is inside the noise a 12-cell search
produces. It is a YARDSTICK, and a yardstick that quietly acquired an edge
would be a broken yardstick.
