tests/check_admission.py  v1.5
THE ADMISSION TABLE, DRIVEN EXHAUSTIVELY (OTV4TEST r35).

v1.5  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r78 — the caps come BACK: the restated SPEC returns
      ORB/RUNAWAY/HUNT/BREAKOUT/VOLT to 1 and B8 is RE-POINTED A SECOND TIME,
      never loosened, to the operator's own sentence — every strategy capped,
      SWEEP alone at 2. 🔴 BREAKOUT JOINS `ALL`: it sat in SPEC but not in the
      list the B-section iterates, so the one strategy that actually stacked —
      19 positions off one opening range — was the one this checker never
      asked about, silently, since r51. B8b is NEW and keeps r76's None
      sentinel exercised on a SYNTHETIC rule through the real `decide()`,
      because restoring the values is not a reason to let the type rot.
v1.4  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r76 — the restated SPEC uncaps six strategies and
      B8 is RE-POINTED: it asserted "sweep 2, every other type 1", which r76
      supersedes. UNCAPPED IS TESTED, NOT SKIPPED — B drives real admission
      with 1, 3 and 25 already open.
v1.3  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r72 — A's restated SPEC gains VOLT at 09:35-11:30,
      from the operator's request rather than from `rules()`. 🔑 THIS CHECK
      WENT RED ON r72 AND THAT IS IT WORKING: it restates the table INSIDE the
      checker by design (r35, §0.4) so a fixture cannot agree with the belief
      under test, which means a NEW STRATEGY MUST make it red. Re-pointed at
      the new contract, never loosened (r33/r43/r64).
v1.2  2026-09-20  OTV4TEST r71 — A's restated SPEC moves SWEEP and TCS to
      15:40, from the operator's 2026-09-20 ruling rather than from `rules()`.
      🔑 THIS CHECK WENT RED ON r71 AND THAT IS IT WORKING. It restates the
      window table INSIDE the checker by design (r35, §0.4) so a fixture cannot
      agree with the belief under test — so a superseded ruling MUST turn it
      red. RE-POINTED AT THE NEW CONTRACT, NOT LOOSENED (r33/r43/r64).
v1.1  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r51 — A0's restated SPEC gains Breakout, from the
      operator's 2026-09-18 ruling rather than from `rules()`.
v1.0  2026-09-17  OTV4TEST r35 — born red at r34 (5ef833e): `risk/admission.py`
      does not exist there, and neither does any single place that can be asked
      "may this plan hand trigger params to this strategy?". Admission was seven
      mechanisms in four files and nothing enumerated them.

WHAT IS PINNED, and it is the OPERATOR'S TABLE, not a paraphrase of it:
  A1-A7    every strategy's window, at BOTH edges, to the minute
  B1-B7    every strategy's concurrency cap, at cap-1, at cap, and above it
  C1-C2    tries-per-session on the two butterflies; unlimited on the rest
  D1-D6    the INTENT: conflicting theses run together, deliberately
  E1-E4    the universals, each refusing on its own name
  F1-F4    the blocking matrix, BOTH directions, via a config override
  G1-G3    the override path itself — partial overrides cannot blank a rule
  H1-H3    purity: same facts, same verdict; inputs never mutated
  X1-X3    the negatives — no VIX gate, unknown strategies fail CLOSED, and
           EVERY gate in gates() is reachable (a gate nothing can trigger is a
           gate nobody knows works — §17, §20's corollary for canaries)
