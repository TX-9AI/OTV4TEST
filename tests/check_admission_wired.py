tests/check_admission_wired.py  v1.2
THE ADMISSION TABLE IS LIVE: A STRATEGY OUTSIDE ITS WINDOW IS NEVER ASKED.

v1.2  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r43 — A9 INVERTED, which is the point of having
      written it. At r40 it pinned the STATED SCOPE (the gate still stands);
      ADM.1 closed, so the assertion flips to "the gate is gone". A scope pin
      that cannot be flipped when the scope changes is just a comment.
v1.1  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r42 — A8 accepts the one-pass accessor. It named
      `eligible_now` specifically; r42 asks via `logging_state()` and A8 went red
      on code that satisfies its own rule. Re-pointed at the rule, kept closed.
v1.0  2026-09-17  OTV4TEST r40 — born red at r39 (ae63024), where `_safe_strategy`
      had no admission test at all and `attempt_new_entry` never called
      `eligible_now()`.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. r35 moved every entry gate into one table and then said so
plainly: *"NOTHING IS WIRED YET — attempt_new_entry still runs the old gates."*
A table nobody reads is not an admission policy, it is documentation. This is the
revision that reads it, and this is the gate that proves it is read.

⚠️ IT DRIVES `_safe_strategy` RATHER THAN MATCHING ITS TEXT. §21: a checker that
greps for `_admission_allows` passes on a call whose result is discarded. Every
assertion below calls the funnel with a probe that RECORDS whether it ran, so
"not asked" means the strategy function was genuinely never invoked.
