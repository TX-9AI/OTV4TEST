tests/check_age_gate_gone.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-08  r321 — A6/A6b: THE REMOVAL IS ASSERTED TREE-WIDE, NOT IN ONE
      MODULE. v1.0 read `sweep_credit_spread.__file__` and nothing else, so
      `criteria.CRITERIA` kept a strict/relaxed pair for the gate r241 had just
      deleted and this file stayed GREEN beside it for four days. A
      removal-checker scoped to the file the removal happened in cannot see the
      copy in the file that DOCUMENTS the removal.
      ⚠️ ASSERTED ON THE DICT, NOT ON SOURCE TEXT — criteria.py's changelog
      necessarily NAMES the key while explaining its removal (§20).
v1.0  2026-09-04  r241 — THE AGE GATE IS REMOVED, NOT RAISED.

🔴 Operator, 2026-09-04: *"I don't give a rat's ass how old the level is, it's
still a level. Why are we still measuring the age of them?"* Because I only
half-shipped his 2026-08-11 ruling. SWP.5 said LIVENESS REPLACES THE CLOCK;
r230 found it had never reached the code and raised the ceiling 6 → 48 instead
of deleting the gate. That was my call, not his.

🔑 AGE MEASURES THE RAID, NOT THE LEVEL. A level swept at 09:45 that has held
since is the SAME LEVEL at 13:00 — arguably better, having held longer. And
levels are swept all day; the morning's is not the only one on the board.

🔴 MEASURED FLEET-WIDE, 2026-08-31..09-04: `age` failed 46,791 of 61,641 (76%),
and on 333 ticks — 26% of every tick that was ONE gate short — it was the ONLY
thing refusing. Complete setups, declined for being old.
