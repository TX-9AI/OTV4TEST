"""tests/check_atp_butterfly.py  v1.2
THE ATP (AT-THE-PIN) BUTTERFLY — ITS PLAN, ITS STRATEGY, ITS EXITS AND ITS SESSION CAP.

v1.2  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r85 — S3/S4 RE-POINTED (r33/r43/r64),
      S4b added as the control: with BOTH traded, neither may be asked, so a
      fix that merely deleted the cap cannot pass.
v1.1  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r43 — S6 reads `_attempt_butterfly`, not
      `attempt_new_entry`: r43 collapsed two butterfly paths into one, so the
      ordering rule (cap on both names, pin fly, then ATP fly) lives in the
      survivor. S6b added — the caller must NOT re-check the cap, because two
      mechanisms for one rule drift.
v1.0  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r26 (BFLY.6, PLAN_SPEC §39). Operator: "traveling to the pin
      is a different thesis than building it on an already sideways tape" and
      "allow one butterfly or the other, whichever plan produces a viable trade
      1st can take it."

🔑 HOP 0 (WORKING_AGREEMENT §21): the plan cases DRIVE `ATPButterflyStrategy.
generate_signal` and read the plan row it wrote; the ladder is FRIDAY 2026-09-11's
REAL 12:28 ET quotes for QQQ 711-719 puts and calls (quote_series), spot 716.01,
pin 715. The exit cases drive `ManagementPlan.decide`; the session cap drives
main's real `_attempt_butterfly` against a temp trades.db with both strategies
replaced by spies, so "was it asked" is observed, not inferred from source.

  P1  at the pin, settled 15 bars, conc 0.26 -> TAKE the 713/715/717 PUT fly,
      debit 0.56, R 2.57 — Friday's answer (the 1-wide leaves spot outside the
      tent; the 713/715/717 call fly fails its own spread at 1.6x)
  P2  ...the signal is a valid butterfly named ATPButterfly with the 40% stop
  P3  spot 2.00 from the pin at EM 5.21 (0.38x — the TRAVEL fly's regime) -> HOLD
      waiting on at_pin
  P4  at the pin but only 6 closed bars inside the band -> HOLD waiting on settled,
      the row saying how many
  P5  no 1m bars -> HOLD, settled names that there were no bars (never a fire)
  P6  GEX TRENDING -> HOLD waiting on pinning
  P7  conc 0.15 with no VWAP -> HOLD on pin_concentration (the shared pin_strength)
  P8  outside the butterfly slot -> dormant, no fire
  P9  a ladder where no wing contains spot -> DECLINE wing_search naming the tent
  M1  the management plan covers ATPButterfly
  M2  an ATP fly at 0.33 on a 0.56 entry (stop 0.336) -> CLOSE stop, 40%
  M3  an ATP fly at 1.30, above its recorded target -> HOLD, riding to the 15:45 flatten
  S1  nothing traded today -> _attempt_butterfly asks the pin fly, then the ATP fly
  S2  the pin fly fires -> the ATP fly is NOT asked
  S3  an ATPButterfly trade today -> NEITHER is asked (one butterfly of either kind)
  S4  a GEXPinButterfly trade today -> NEITHER is asked
  S5  _STRUCTURE_BY_NAME maps ATPButterfly to "butterfly" (else the cutoff reads it
      as a long debit)
  S6  the in-dispatch slot (attempt_new_entry, not drivable without a full tick)
      checks the cap on both names before asking either, pin fly first

Born red at r25 (1c8f293): every case, since neither module exists there.
