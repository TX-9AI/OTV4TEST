"""check_attr_fidelity.py — v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-23 — OTV4TEST r126. The `sweep` subject (analysis.liquidity_mapper
      .LiquiditySweep) and its A2 regression pin (bars_ago / bars_since_reclaim)
      are removed with the mapper, which is deleted. The other four stay.

🔴 THE GATE FOR THE FAILURE THAT COST FIVE SETUPS IN ONE WEEK.

Every one of these shipped, and every one is the same shape — a name read off
an object that does not have it:

    ctm.all()                        real: all_rails()
    getattr(c, "oi")                 real: open_interest
    _f(ctx.get("gex"))               real: a GEXSnapshot OBJECT, not a float
    getattr(sweep, "bars_since_reclaim")   real: bars_ago
    getattr(orb, "tp50")             real: target_50pct

⚠️ `getattr` WITH A DEFAULT CANNOT RAISE. No traceback, no log line, no red
test — the gate simply never applies. A DEAD gate and a gate that keeps passing
are indistinguishable from outside. `oi` blinded the butterfly for its entire
existence; `target_50pct` refused every runaway on eight boxes at 09:51 on a
breakout morning while printing "50% TP n/a".

⚠️ AND UNIT TESTS CANNOT CATCH IT WHEN ONE AUTHOR WRITES BOTH THE CALLER AND
THE FIXTURE — they are wrong the same way and the board goes green. This check
resolves against the REAL imported classes, never a stand-in.

HOW IT WORKS: for each (variable name -> class) binding declared in _SUBJECTS
below, every `getattr(var, "name")` and `var.name(...)` in the scanned tree is
resolved against that class's annotations, slots and dir(). Unknown names fail.

ADDING A SUBJECT: one line in _SUBJECTS. If a variable name is used for two
different types anywhere in the tree, do NOT add it — a false positive here
trains people to ignore the gate, which is worse than not having it.
