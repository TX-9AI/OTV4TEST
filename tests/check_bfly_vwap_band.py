"""tests/check_bfly_vwap_band.py  v1.3
v1.3  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r101 - A8/A9: the cold-start deep fetch
      must use the CALLER's symbol, and an EMPTY fetch must WARN. Born red at
      1104492 where `_accumulate_vwap` takes no symbol and says nothing.
v1.2  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r96 — A7 pins that a PARTIAL session reports its real start
      rather than the open. Born red against r94, which stamped a one-hour
      VWAP with a session anchor and passed every other check in this file.
v1.1  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r94 — A5/A6, AND THE OLD FIXTURE IS WHY THIS HID.
      It wrote the literal "primary" and then A4 asserted the reader reads
      "primary" - a closed loop supplying its own answer, section 0.4. A5 now
      writes EVERY interval the engine really emits and demands the reader find
      each, so a reader pinned to any single literal fails; A6 refuses a
      midnight anchor by name. Neither passes against the pre-r94 reader.
A PIN AT TODAY'S VWAP MEETS THE BUTTERFLY'S CONCENTRATION CONDITION (BFLY.5).

v1.0  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r25. Operator: "VWAP replaces the floor if the pin is
      w/in a predefined portion of VWAP" — "W/in 20% of the expected move,
      expressed as 10% above, 10% below." The VWAP is the bot's own
      midnight-ET-anchored one (indicator_series 'primary'), read through
      `anchors.vwap_now()`, which refuses a prior session's anchor or a stale bar.

🔑 HOP 0 (WORKING_AGREEMENT §21): every case DRIVES the real
`GEXPinButterflyStrategy.generate_signal` against a real DerivedStore in a temp
file holding real indicator_series rows, and reads the verdict off the plan row
it wrote. The fixture ladder is check_plan_prepares' `calls_good`: pin 101,
spot 99, EM 4.12 at the pinned 12:30 clock, so the band is ±0.41.

  W1  conc 0.15 (under the 0.25 floor), today's fresh VWAP 0.20 from the pin
      -> TAKE, and the row says the floor was WAIVED and by how much
  W2  the same with VWAP 1.00 away -> HOLD waiting on pin_concentration, the
      row naming the distance
  W3  a VWAP anchored to a PRIOR session, 0.10 from the pin -> no waiver
      (the engine writes Friday's VWAP all weekend)
  W4  today's anchor but a bar ten minutes old -> no waiver (a stalled feed)
  W5  no VWAP row at all -> no waiver, and the row says there was no VWAP
  W6  control: conc 0.60 meets the floor on its own; no waiver is claimed
  W7  the distance is recorded on the tick as `pin_vwap_dist`, waived or not
  A4  `anchors.vwap()` reads the 'primary' interval the engine actually writes

Born red at r24 (577ceb1) on W1-W5, W7 and A4: no waiver exists there, so W1 holds
instead of taking and no row names a VWAP distance or why there is none, and
vwap() queried '1m'. W6 is the control, green on both sides.

# 🔴 r94 — THE INTERVAL COMES FROM THE ENGINE, NEVER FROM THIS FILE.
# THE OLD FIXTURE WROTE THE LITERAL "primary" AND THEN A4 ASSERTED THAT THE
# READER READS "primary" — a closed loop that supplied its own answer (§0.4),
# and it is the whole reason this went unnoticed for two days. `primary` was
# never a timeframe: it is the FALLBACK row in `indicators.derive()`, emitted
# only `if not rows`. r69 repaired the per-timeframe loop, the fallback stopped
# firing, and `vwap_now()` spent two days querying a row nobody writes —
# MEASURED 2026-09-22: 882 rows each for 5m/15m/1h/1d all carrying a VWAP,
# `primary` last seen 09-20 13:29 ET, the minute r69 landed.
# 🔑 SO THE FIXTURE ASKS THE ENGINE. If the writer's interval set changes
# again, this file follows it instead of pinning a stale literal — and A4
# becomes a real assertion rather than a restatement of its own setup.
# ⚠️ A REAL PRODUCTION INTERVAL, AND MY FIRST CUT GUESSED IT FROM THE SOURCE.
# That helper walked `indicators.py` for string literals and returned
# "primary" — because the real frames arrive at runtime as `vote.timeframe`
# and appear nowhere in the source. It would have kept the fixture writing the
# very dead row this revision exists to stop reading. MEASURED on the live
# store 2026-09-22: the engine writes 5m, 15m, 1h and 1d.
# 🔑 THE FIXTURE'S INTERVAL BARELY MATTERS NOW — A5 below writes EVERY one of
# them and demands the reader find each, which is the property that was
# actually broken. This is just a sane default rather than a load-bearing
# guess.
