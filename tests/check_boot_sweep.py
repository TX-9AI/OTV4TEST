tests/check_boot_sweep.py  v1.2
v1.2  2026-09-25  OTV4TEST r144 — B3/B3b REQUIRE THE SIGNAL JOURNAL IN SCRATCH TOO
      (OT_SIGNAL_JOURNAL_DIR under the same bootsweep- mkdtemp). The sweep wrote
      ~126 retest_check fixtures a day into the live journal; on SOFI/AAL they
      reached sym=QQQ in the warehouse. Born red at 247facf.
v1.1  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r109 — B3 NAMES THE THIRD STORE, AND B3b DRIVES IT.
      The live `resting_orders.db` held 91 checker fixture rows because
      run_one isolated only the trades and derived stores. B3b calls the REAL
      run_one with the subprocess intercepted and asserts every store it hands
      a checker lives inside that run's own scratch directory — born red at
      2c17b2e on OT_RESTING_DB.
v1.0  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r86 — born RED at 4b1e9a2 (the tool does not exist).

🔴 WHY THIS TOOL EXISTS, MEASURED. Landing a ONE-LINE change cost **297
checker invocations** — about 11 minutes — and the operator called it: *"that
is entirely ludicrous… The 30-minute per commit cycle is choking our commit
rate for needed changes."* His own fix was better than the one proposed to
him: *"You have an AWS auto boot daily at 0800. Why not run the full set then
& do the abbreviated when we're actively trying to land."*

⚠️ THE TOOL IS INFRASTRUCTURE AND §29 APPLIES: nothing here may become
load-bearing for trading. These checks exist to keep it that way.

  B1  it ALWAYS exits 0 — a red finding is not an infrastructure fault
  B2  it SKIPS itself when memory is tight rather than racing the live bot
  B3  every checker runs against SCRATCH stores, never the live ones
  B4  the interpreter is PINNED, not inherited (ENV.1)
  B5  the result is a DIFF (new/fixed), not a bare count — 11 standing reds
      mean "134 of 145" tells nobody anything
