"""tests/check_breakout_research.py — v1.0
THE OBSERVER POSTURE IS REAL, IT EXPIRES, AND BREAKOUT IS THE ORB WITHOUT THE RETEST.

v1.0  2026-09-19 — OTV4TEST r55. Operator: *"Have it trade every break that gets
      a 1-minute candle acceptance beyond the boundary, stop distance is the
      extreme of the impulsive candle that registered the break, sized the same
      as the orb, informers are just observers for 2 weeks."*  And the invariant:
      *"if we do get an orb trade a breakout trade should've preceded it, because
      it's the same trade but without the retest."*

🔑 R6 IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. His invariant holds only while Breakout's BINDING
bars are a SUBSET of the ORB's. The ORB has no width band, no level-cleanliness
rule, no pool rule and no R floor — so if any of those binds, an ORB trade can
fire that Breakout refused, and the two have silently diverged.

⚠️ EVERY IMPORT IS GUARDED. A checker that CRASHES at base proves nothing, and
this repo has paid for that four times (r32, r37, r39, r41).

  R1  every informer is a DIAL and today each reads 'any'
  R2  the dials get NUMBERS after the window — the acceptance expires itself
  R3  an unreadable expiry FAILS CLOSED (the dials bind), never fails open
  R4  'any' admits every value, including an ABSENT reading
  R5  the dials refuse out-of-band values once they are numbers
  R6  INVARIANT: nothing blocks while acceptance is 'any' -> Breakout ⊆ ORB
  R6b and the informers are still DECLARED TRIGGERS, not bypassed
  R7  Breakout declares it sizes on geometry, and geometry is a different size
  R8  the hunt and runaway do NOT declare it (blast radius of r55's sizing fix)
  R9  the declared structure_stop is the impulsive-candle extreme, and HOLDs on
      a return into the range
  R10 Breakout will not stack on itself while one is open
