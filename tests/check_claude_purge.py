"""tests/check_claude_purge.py — v1.1
tmpfs IS PURGED BEFORE A THREAD STARTS, AND CLAUDE LAUNCHES ON THE SUBSCRIPTION.

v1.1  2026-09-23 — OTV4TEST r107. P9 RE-DERIVED TO THE STRONGER CONTRACT, NOT
      LOOSENED. It matched the literal `if a.dry_run or agent_alive():`, and
      r107 made the skip ALSO require that no `claude` process of this user is
      alive (`live_claude_pids()`), because `agent_alive()` asks about one tmux
      name and check_claude_boot B7 defeated it by overriding that name — ten
      times the real scratch root was purged under a running agent. P9 now
      requires BOTH terms in the gate and the pid scan feeding it, so dropping
      either one goes red.
      🔴 AND P1/P2 NOW ARCHIVE INTO A THROWAWAY HOME. They purged fixtures into
      the REAL ~/claude_scratch_archive (60 litter entries by 2026-09-23), and
      the archive name is stamped to the SECOND — so two purges inside one
      second collided: `shutil.move` nested the second `sessOLD` INSIDE the
      first (`20260923-011250-sessOLD/sessOLD` is on disk) or failed into the
      bare `except`, and P1/P2 went red on correct code. Reproduced on the
      unmodified r107 tool, 2 runs of 2 back to back. P8 already redirected
      HOME; P1 and P2 did not.

v1.0  2026-09-20 — OTV4TEST r70 (BOX.12 / AUTH.1).

🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. `/tmp` is a **tmpfs — it is RAM**: 455 MB here of 908 MB
physical. The agent scratchpad path is keyed by SESSION ID
(`/tmp/claude-<uid>/<project>/<session-uuid>/scratchpad`), so every new session
mints a directory and NOTHING removes the old ones. One session reached 108 MB
in a day. This box was protected only by its daily reboot — tmpfs is volatile —
while the control box, which does not reboot daily, filled its tmpfs and then
**every Bash spawn died instantly with no stdout and no stderr**, because a
temp file is needed for the shell snapshot and the spawn fails before it
executes. Read/Write kept working, so the agent looked brain-dead rather than
out of space, with nothing logged anywhere (§0.5).

🔑 ORDER IS THE OPERATOR'S RULING AND IT IS NOT COSMETIC: **purge, THEN kill,
THEN launch.** If tmpfs is already full the tmux kill may not spawn either, so
freeing space first is what guarantees room for every step after it.

  P0  the purge REFUSES a root that is not /tmp/claude-<digits> (fail closed)
  P1  it removes a stale session directory
  P2  it NEVER removes the LIVE session's own directory (CLAUDE_SCRATCH)
  P3  free-space reporting returns a plausible figure
  P4  the boot status string carries the free-tmpfs figure, so it reaches the
      boot Telegram beside the IP with no change to alert_manager
  P5  every devtools launch site PURGES BEFORE IT KILLS — asserted on line
      order with comments stripped, because a comment naming a step is not the
      step (r37's finding about bake())
  P6  every `claude` launch site strips the API-key variables, so a stray
      export cannot silently move sessions onto metered credits
  P7  CONTROL: this checker never touches the box's real scratch root
  P8  it ARCHIVES rather than deletes — raised by the mainline control agent
      from a near-miss where a deleting purge would have destroyed an entire
      unlanded revision sitting in a handed-off session's scratchpad
  P9  a LIVE session skips the purge ENTIRELY. The first cut purged
      unconditionally while `bring_up()` returns "already running" WITHOUT
      killing anything — so starting the unit against a live session would
      have archived that running agent's working directory out from under it
  P10 the 14-day retention sweep is the only deleting path, and it is bounded

⚠️ TRANSCRIPTS ARE NOT AT RISK AND THAT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. They live on
EXT4 under `~/.claude/projects/` — a different filesystem — so the purge cannot
reach them and `tools/last_session.py` still reviews the previous thread after
a handoff. That is the property that makes purging safe to do aggressively.
