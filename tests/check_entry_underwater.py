"""tests/check_entry_underwater.py — v1.0
NO TRADE OPENS ALREADY THROUGH ITS OWN STOP (ENT.1).

v1.0  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r61 — built for the operator's ENT.1 ruling: STRICT
      (at or beyond the stop is through) and UNCONDITIONAL (*"any strategy…it
      should NEVER happen"*). Drives `main._execute_entry_signal`, the one
      function every entry opens through, with a spy on `entry_engine.enter`,
      and asks whether the ORDER WAS PLACED rather than whether the source
      contains a guard (§21). Born red 5 of 10 at 375dd68.

Operator's ruling, 2026-09-19: *"any strategy check on the firing tick one final
time that the entry is not crossing the stop before the trade even opens — not
that it would happen often otherwise, but that it should NEVER happen."* STRICT:
at or beyond the stop is through. No band, no constant.

🔑 IT DRIVES `main._execute_entry_signal` AND ASKS WHETHER THE ORDER WAS PLACED.
Not whether the source contains a guard — WORKING_AGREEMENT 21: twelve tests once
asserted the source text held a call whose NAME WAS NEVER BOUND, over a NameError
that crash-looped every box. The probe here is a spy on `entry_engine.enter`:
refused means `enter` was never reached.

⚠️ THE FIXTURES ARE VALID SIGNALS FIRST. A signal that fails `is_valid` is refused
one branch EARLIER, for a different reason, and every case would pass vacuously —
the §21 trap wearing this revision's clothes. E0 proves the fixture fires when it
is not underwater, so a refusal downstream means the guard and nothing else.

  E0  a clean long fires          (the fixture is not self-refuting)
  E1  long, price BELOW its stop        -> REFUSED
  E1b short, price ABOVE its stop       -> REFUSED
  E2  STRICT: price EXACTLY the stop    -> REFUSED   (no band, no tolerance)
  E3  control: clean short fires
  E4  control: a THESIS stop (LiquidityHunt) fires though it is "through"
  E5  control: no underlying stop at all (runaway/credit shape) fires
  E6  LiquidityHunt DECLARES the opt-out, as an assignment (§20, not a mention)
  E7  OptionsSignal defaults to CHECKED — the opt-out is opt-OUT
  E8  one funnel: `enter(signal=` appears exactly once in main.py

Born red at 375dd68 (r60) on E1, E1b, E2. E0/E3/E4/E5/E7/E8 are CONTROLS, green
on both sides; E6 is red at base because the declaration does not exist there.
