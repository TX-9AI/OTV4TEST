v1.2  2026-09-08  r317: W8 — THE END SIDE, WHICH THIS FILE NEVER ASSERTED.
      W1 has pinned ONE credit START across four paths since r146, written
      after the sweep kept 11:11 on a `getattr` default whose key did not
      exist. `SWEEP_CS_LATEST_ET` was the SAME DEFECT on the END and survived
      both sweeps because nothing here looked at ends at all. Born red at
      0498534, where `C.SWEEP_CS_LATEST_ET` raises AttributeError.
      ⚠️ W8 GOES RED ON A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE TOO, and that is the point:
      if a future ruling gives one credit path its own cutoff, this check is
      how that decision gets recorded rather than absorbed. Update it WITH the
      ruling; do not loosen it to keep a run green.
v1.1  2026-08-26  r146: W7 re-pinned to each strategy's PLAN_CHECKS after the
      builder engine was deleted.

🔴 ONE START TIME FOR EVERY CREDIT SPREAD, AND ONE MINUTE OF DAYLIGHT.

Operator, 2026-08-26: a universal credit start "to keep things tidy". The
number is 11:31 rather than 11:30 because of his own 2026-08-24 ruling —
*"Handoff (credit) needs to start at 1131 - it's colliding with runaway (same
trigger)"* — and because the debit cutoff test is `>= (11, 30)`, so the debit
is blocked AT 11:30. A credit start of 11:30 would hand both the same minute
and reproduce the collision that ruling fixed.

⚠️ SECONDS CANNOT EXPRESS A FINER BOUNDARY. Every gate compares
`(now.hour, now.minute)`; 11:30:01 and 11:30:59 are the same tuple. The tick is
30s besides, so a sub-minute boundary would land wherever each box's restart
drift happened to put it.
