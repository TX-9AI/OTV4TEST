"""check_entry_windows.py — v1.4
v1.4  2026-09-24  OTV4TEST r128: FOUR STALE ASSERTIONS AND TWO HOLLOW GREENS
      RE-POINTED AT WHERE THE CODE LIVES NOW. Every property is MOVED, NOT
      DROPPED (section 38.4). Fork r5 (8a36b6f) moved the sweep's logic into
      strategy/sweep_plan.py, and r3/r9 moved PLAN_CHECKS onto the plan
      classes; this file kept reading the old homes.
      · W9pre: the recorder wrapped `relaxed.window`, which the sweep no longer
        calls at all - its window is the fixed EARLIEST_ET/LATEST_ET pair
        (sweep_plan.py:132-133) compared in `prepare()`. The property ("the
        sweep window is never relaxable") is now an AST check: sweep_plan.py
        calls no relaxed.window / relaxed.widen and imports neither by name.
      · W9: EXECUTES the real window gate - SweepCreditSpreadStrategy().prepare
        (which delegates to SweepPlan.prepare) at every minute 09:30-16:00
        under OT_RELAXED_ENTRY=0 and =1 (paper, so relaxed is genuinely
        allowed) and asserts the entry_window outcome is identical minute for
        minute. Plan rows go to an in-memory store, never a live one.
      · W9b: SUPERSEDED BY PLAN_SPEC 31.2 (docs/PLAN_SPEC.md:1271), which set
        the sweep window to open 09:35 on purpose. It pinned the applied start
        to CREDIT_ENTRY_START_ET (11:31); it now pins the APPLIED window,
        measured from the W9 run, to config.SWEEP_CS_EARLIEST_ET_FORK (09:35)
        -> CREDIT_ENTRY_END_ET, in both modes.
      · W7: read PLAN_CHECKS off the STRATEGY classes; three of them now set it
        per instance from their plan. It reads the declaring classes: RunawayPlan
        (runaway_plan.py:154), TCSPlan (tcs_plan.py:212), SweepPlan
        (sweep_plan.py:285), GEXPinButterflyStrategy, IronCondorStrategy.
      · W1 / W5 (HOLLOW GREENS): compared sweep_credit_spread.EARLIEST_ET and
        C.SWEEP_CS_EARLIEST_ET, constants nothing live reads. W1 now holds the
        universal start on condor + TCS and pins the sweep's own ruled start
        (C.SWEEP_CS_EARLIEST_ET_FORK == 09:35, PLAN_SPEC 31.2); W5 asserts
        sweep_plan.EARLIEST_ET is that config value.
      Plus the r106 venv bootstrap (the lander runs CHECKs under
      /usr/bin/python3).
v1.3  2026-09-08  r321: W9 — THE WINDOW A STRATEGY COMPUTES, NOT THE CONSTANT
      IT DECLARES. W5 asserts `sweep.EARLIEST_ET == CREDIT_ENTRY_START_ET` and
      was green while the sweep OPENED AT 09:45 under relaxed, because
      `prepare()` passes its constants through `relaxed.window()` and the
      `relaxed_earliest` default is "09:45" — a value nobody chose for this
      strategy. W9 drives the same call the strategy makes, in BOTH modes, and
      asserts the applied window is identical. Born red at 82d369e.
v1.2  2026-09-08  r317: W8 — THE END SIDE, WHICH THIS FILE NEVER ASSERTED.
      W1 has pinned ONE credit START across four paths since r146, written
      after the sweep kept 11:11 on a `getattr` default whose key did not
      exist. `SWEEP_CS_LATEST_ET` was the SAME DEFECT on the END and survived
      both sweeps because nothing here looked at ends at all. Born red at
      0498534, where `C.SWEEP_CS_LATEST_ET` raises AttributeError.
      ⚠️ W8 GOES RED ON A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE TOO, and that is the point:
      if a future ruling gives one credit path its own cutoff, this check is
      how that decision gets recorded rather than absorbed. Update it WITH the
      ruling; do not loosen it to keep a run green.
v1.1  2026-08-26  r146: W7 re-pinned to each strategy's PLAN_CHECKS after the
      builder engine was deleted.

🔴 ONE START TIME FOR EVERY CREDIT SPREAD, AND ONE MINUTE OF DAYLIGHT.

Operator, 2026-08-26: a universal credit start "to keep things tidy". The
number is 11:31 rather than 11:30 because of his own 2026-08-24 ruling —
*"Handoff (credit) needs to start at 1131 - it's colliding with runaway (same
trigger)"* — and because the debit cutoff test is `>= (11, 30)`, so the debit
is blocked AT 11:30. A credit start of 11:30 would hand both the same minute
and reproduce the collision that ruling fixed.

⚠️ SECONDS CANNOT EXPRESS A FINER BOUNDARY. Every gate compares
`(now.hour, now.minute)`; 11:30:01 and 11:30:59 are the same tuple. The tick is
30s besides, so a sub-minute boundary would land wherever each box's restart
drift happened to put it.
