"""tests/check_exit_replay.py — v1.1
THE PREMIUM-REPLAY TOOL IS GATED (RPL.1).

v1.1  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r63 — X8/X9/X10 added for r63's three repairs to
      r62: the anchored stop regex, and a positive control that can no longer
      pass on an empty set. The band's independence from the derived stop is
      mutation-proven rather than asserted here, and the header says so.
v1.0  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r62 — `tests/exit_replay.py` carried six defects and
      NOTHING RAN IT. It is not a `check_*.py`, so the sweep never touched it,
      and its `--selftest` takes an argument the lander's CHECK directive cannot
      pass. It therefore sat at 0 of 44 replayed, announcing that the TAPE was
      empty, for as long as anyone had been reading its output. This wrapper
      puts it inside the sweep and inside every land.

🔑 IT RUNS THE TOOL'S OWN SELFTEST AND THEN ASSERTS THE THINGS THAT SELFTEST
CANNOT: that the orientation resolver actually imported (not a silent fallback),
and that the closing verdict is GATED so it can never blame the tape while the
tool is naming its own refusals.

⚠️ NOTHING HERE TOUCHES A LIVE STORE. The selftest is `:memory:`; the verdict
case drives `run()` with an empty fetch and an in-memory row.

  X1  the tool's own selftest passes
  X2  the orientation resolver IMPORTED — no silent fallback to the dead flag
  X3  ...and it resolves a credit structure as credit (it is wired, not merely present)
  X4  OCC -> streamer, including a split-adjusted root and a half-strike
  X5  a butterfly is weighted 1/2/1
  X6  the verdict cannot blame the tape when refusals exist
  X7  `option_symbol` resolves a single-leg debit
  X8  the stop regex is ANCHORED — a prefixed or credit-basis stop is not a premium stop
  X9  a control that applied to NOTHING shouts UNVERIFIED, never passes silently
  X10 ...and when it did apply, the run says to how many

⚠️ X9/X10 EXIST BECAUSE THE BAND ITSELF IS NOT DIRECTLY OBSERVABLE FROM HERE.
That the tolerance no longer scales with the derived stop is proven by MUTATION
(revert it and the butterfly row's verdict flips), not by this file — stated so
nobody reads X9 as covering it.
