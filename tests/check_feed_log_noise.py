"""tests/check_feed_log_noise.py — v1.0
THE FEED'S JOURNAL CARRIES THE FEED, NOT THE SDK'S WEBSOCKET FRAMES — AND
DROPPED DATA STAYS VISIBLE.

v1.0  2026-09-24 — OTV4TEST r134. tastytrade 13.2.3 hard-sets its logger to
      DEBUG (tastytrade/__init__.py:13), so every frame passed data/candle_feed.py's
      INFO basicConfig: MEASURED 2,895 of 2,988 journal lines in five minutes. One
      kind of SDK DEBUG line is not chatter: "Failed to parse event" is a print
      the SDK THREW AWAY (173 in 30 minutes, all fractional-share TimeAndSale
      sizes). The filter must drop the first and keep the second.

  L0  the premise still holds: the SDK's logger is at DEBUG (else this is moot)
  L1  SDK DEBUG chatter from a CHILD logger (tastytrade.streamer) is dropped
  L2  SDK DEBUG "Failed to parse event" is KEPT
  L3  SDK WARNING and above are kept
  L4  our own loggers are not touched by the filter
  L5  END TO END: root handler + the real installer + the real SDK loggers —
      chatter absent from the output, the parse failure present
  L6  installing twice adds ONE filter per handler
  L7  main() installs it immediately after basicConfig (AST)
