tests/check_ledger_parity.py  v1.4
v1.4  2026-09-08  r317 — L7: NO ID CARRIES TWO BYTE-IDENTICAL ROWS. Four did
      (ORB.3 x3, ORB.4 x3, S3.1 x2, S3.6 x2) and every existing check passed
      over them, because L1/L5/L6 test for the CONTRADICTION case and
      identical copies contradict nothing. Scoped to VERBATIM copies only:
      differing rows per id are the ledger's own per-revision idiom.
v1.3  2026-09-08  r317 — 🔴 L3 READ day_trader_pro's REVISION NUMBERS AS THIS
      REPO'S, AND HAS SINCE THE TWO SEQUENCES OVERLAPPED. `\br305\b` matches
      the "dtp r305" in an otv4 row, so a CROSS-REPO citation counted as a
      same-repo one. otv4's GENESIS cites 31 distinct dtp revisions and 28 of
      them HAPPEN to collide with a real otv4 row number, so the check stayed
      quiet by luck; only 305, 309 and 316 fall outside otv4's range, and
      those three are the entire red. It now requires the citation to be
      un-prefixed.
      ⚠️ THE TEMPTING FIX WAS THE WRONG ONE. Adding 305/309/316 to
      `KNOWN_ROWLESS_CITATIONS` turns the board green and leaves the check
      measuring the wrong thing — it would go quiet until dtp's numbering next
      escapes otv4's range, and the allow-list is for holes this repo cannot
      explain, not for a pattern that never applied. Same class as the r230
      finding: a rule pointing at the wrong thing is worse than no rule.
      ⚠️ AND THE COLLISION IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL IN THE OTHER DIRECTION — with
      28 numbers shared, any genuine otv4 hole whose number a dtp citation
      happens to mention was equally invisible. Whether one is hiding under
      the fix is now answerable, and the run below says: none.
v1.2  2026-09-04  r245 — 🔴 THE OPEN LIST MATCHES THE STATE MARKER,
      NOT THE WORD. It asked whether "OPEN" appeared anywhere in the state
      cell, and the older rows carry a long `◐ PUSHED…` narrative there
      containing "OPENED" and "opening" — so CLOSED items read as open, TEN
      false positives out of 25. I recommended work on BFLY.2 as though it
      were live and then argued from a defect r197 had already fixed.
      ⚠️ THIRD INSTRUMENT TO MISLEAD IN ONE EVENING, after the stop-forensics
      count and its verdict line. All three read a proxy instead of the
      thing itself. L6 pins the five markers against a fixture.
v1.1  2026-09-04  r241 — r226 JOINS THE KNOWN-ROWLESS SET. r240's own
      GENESIS row cites it by name while explaining that it rebuilds it, so
      the citation became "cited but rowless" the moment r240 landed — caught
      by this checker the same day it was written. The citation IS the record
      of why the number is missing, not evidence of a lost row.
v1.0  2026-09-04  r240 — THE TWO LEDGERS MUST AGREE, AND THE BACKLOG MUST BE
      ABLE TO ANSWER "WHAT IS OPEN". Both had stopped being true.

🔴 MEASURED at 45988b6 (BACKLOG v1.57, GENESIS 226 rows, r1..r239):
  • 25 rows read `🔲 OPEN`, and FOUR of those ids — SWEEP.2, SWEEP.3, SWEEP.4,
    TCS.8 — also carry a later `✅ CLOSED` row. Entries are per-revision and
    append-only, so closing an item leaves its earlier OPEN row in place.
    SWEEP.2 appears on FOUR rows. Roughly a third of the open list was wrong.
  • r226 is CLAIMED BY A BACKLOG ENTRY and has NO GENESIS ROW. §35: a revision
    absent from the ledger did not happen.
  • GENESIS skips 13 numbers (r42, 49, 89, 97, 109, 110, 111, 117, 123, 141,
    151, 159, 226). Nine are absent everywhere — allocated and never used,
    which is fine. THREE are cited in GENESIS prose by other revisions
    (r110, r141, r159) but have no row of their own, which is not.

⚠️ THE POINT IS NOT TIDINESS. Every prioritisation starts by reading the open
list, and a list that is a third wrong sends the next session at work that is
already done. This checker makes that state a RED rather than a discovery.
