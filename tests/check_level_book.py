tests/check_level_book.py  v1.1
THE LEVEL BOOK, DRIVEN ON HAND-BUILT TAPES.

v1.1  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r110 — K11, K12: the book moved to ET-clock blocks built
      from the 1m tape (pre-market ends 09:30), with an hourly fallback.
v1.0  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST LVL.15 step 2 (unlanded WIP). Born RED where
      `derived/level_book.py` does not exist — NAMED failures, not a traceback.

  K1  the day is FOUR contiguous blocks covering 00->24Z in BOTH DST offsets,
      and the last is AFTER-HOURS (16:00-20:00 ET in summer)
  K2  a session STILL FORMING is not a level (ruling 2026-09-22)
  K3  identity is side + price — NO session label; one price printed by two
      sessions is ONE level, dated by the newer formation
  K4  a level becomes live at its session's END, not at its print
  K5  a single level: wick-in + close back = HELD; close beyond + open beyond
      = BREACHED and it leaves the book
  K6  a ZONE: a breach of the FAR edge retires EVERY member (r39 kept)
  K7  a ZONE: a close past the near edge but short of the far one leaves the
      zone LIVE and is NOT a HELD (rulings 09-23, "b")
  K8  the walk: newest first, each older rung only if FURTHER out (r29), and
      a nearer-but-older level is not on the board
  K9  the board anchors on the opening-range edges when given
  K10 no module in the new book imports the old mapper or the old level files
  K11 v1.1: pre-market ends 09:30 ET — a 09:27 low is a pre-market level,
      live at 09:30 (red on v1.0's hour-granular blocks)
  K12 v1.1: an hourly candle wholly inside a block supplies an extreme the
      seeded 1m tape is missing (green on v1.0 too: it pins the fallback)
  K1b/K2b v1.1: K1 and K2 on the ET-clock path build() uses (K1/K2 pin the
      hourly helpers, which build() no longer calls)
