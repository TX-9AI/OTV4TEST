tests/check_level_engine_book.py  v1.2
v1.2  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r124 — E9: the board's zone width comes from the BOOK the
      engine builds (book.width), with NO ctx["level_tape"] — main.py no longer
      sends one. Red on r123, where board() measured the width from that tape.
THE LIVE LEVEL ENGINE PUBLISHES THE LEVEL BOOK — driven through `derive()`.

v1.1  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r111 — E8: the ledger reads TRAVERSED for a level retired
      inside the opening range.
v1.0  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST LVL.15 step 2 (r110; carries the r106 venv bootstrap). Born RED at 7df8438, where the engine
      has no book path: `derive()` on the same tape publishes nothing.

Every plan that trades levels reads `level_ledger` (the board) and
`level_event` (REJECTED for the sweep, ACCEPTED for the TCS). Step 2 changes
WHERE those rows come from — the book, on the operator's definitions — and
nothing about who reads them. So the contract is the two tables:

  E1 a BREACHED (1m close beyond, next 1m open beyond) is published as
     ACCEPTED on the level, stamped with the bar that opened beyond
  E2 a HELD is published as REJECTED, and its pierce is the deepest point
     beyond the near edge over the whole TESTED->HELD episode (r44)
  E3 §37: after a restart the book replays, and an event older than
     BOOK_FRESH_S is NOT published — an old trigger never reaches a plan
  E4 the ledger holds exactly the book's live levels: an old-format row is
     retired, the book's level is live, and a breached one retires BREACHED
  E5 a second derive on the same closed bar publishes nothing new
  E6 hop 0: `derive()` routes to the book when LEVEL_SOURCE is "book"
  E8 a level the book retired inside the opening range is retired TRAVERSED
     in the ledger, never BREACHED (operator's ruling 2026-09-23)
  E9 the board's zone width is the book's own (level_book.zone_width of the
     same hourly bars), set by the sync, with no level_tape in ctx (r124)
  E7 a HELD judged on the HOUR (no 1m candle in its episode — a feed hole)
     is published with the hourly pierce and does NOT fail the sync. Red on
     the first cut of this engine: max() of an empty span raised and froze the
     ledger; found by mutating the freshness window, which surfaced it.
