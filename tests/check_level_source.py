tests/check_level_source.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-17  OTV4TEST r33 — born red 12 of 16 at r32 (6587143), which is the
      divergence reproduced exactly: S1/S2/S4 on the sweep's and the TCS's private
      compositions, S5/S6 on a board that could not walk from spot, S9/S11-S16 on
      an accessor that had no anchor, no shared entry point and no fork product.
ONE BOARD FOR EVERY PLAN THAT TRADES LEVELS, AND THE FORK BESIDE IT (OTV4TEST r33).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The operator ruled it at r5 — *"LEVELS IN PLAY come from
the derived store, NEVER A PRIVATE MAP: 3 named up, 3 named down, plus the 1h
pitchfork's tines"* — and on 2026-09-17 three plans had three private
compositions of that one board:
  · `liquidity_hunt` through `board()`                       (correct)
  · `sweep_plan`  through `live_levels()` + a local `level_map.walk()` with the
    rails APPENDED INTO the level list                        (r19 conjoined)
  · `tcs_plan`    through `live_levels()` filtered to `provenance == "ny"`,
    with no fork at all                                       (3 of 11 levels)

⚠️ NOT ONE GATE IN THIS REPO COULD SEE THAT. The write map says who writes a
table; the file map says who imports what; `check_map_accuracy` checks tables,
units and entry points. None of them can tell that two plans ask one store two
different questions. That is why the divergence survived r15, r19, r29 and r30 —
every one of which touched levels — and surfaced only when a human read the code.

S1/S2 are the ABSENCE canaries and are scoped to a CALL SITE, never a mention
(§20): a changelog that says "this no longer calls live_levels()" must not trip
them, which is why they match `store.live_levels(` and `level_map.walk(` rather
than the bare names.
