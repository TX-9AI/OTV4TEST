THE LEVEL BOOK IS BUILT FROM THE HOURLY TAPE, AND ITS BREACHES ARE JUDGED ON 1m.

v2.0  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r126 — derived/level_map and the old mapper are DELETED
      (LVL.15 step 5), so the checks that pinned THEIR internals retire with
      them, and the three that pin the DATA the book depends on stay:
      KEPT  T2 (no PARTIAL hourly bar - it caught a real corruption on 09-18,
            and the book builds every level from these bars) and T8 (1m
            retention covers 1h, r108 - the book judges BREACHED on 1m).
      MOVED T7 (reach > 30 days) now reads the book's own bar loader,
            derived/level_book.load_bars, not level_map.load_tape.
      RETIRED T1/T1b (load_tape's default interval), T3 (the mapper's section
            hours), T4 (level_map's daily source), T5 (`_derive_events`, the
            legacy engine path) - all four name code that no longer exists.
      COVERED ELSEWHERE T6 (the opening-range rule): check_level_book K14 and
            check_level_engine_book E8 pin it on the book path.
      And the r106 venv bootstrap.

v1.2  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r108 — T8: 1m RETENTION MUST COVER 1h RETENTION.
      Levels are built from the hourly tape; the operator's BREACHED rule is a
      1-minute rule (a 1m close beyond, the next 1m open beyond). MEASURED on
      08-25..09-22 warehouse tape with hourly bars built from the SAME 1m bars:
      of 142 extremes the 1m rule breached, the hourly test was more than an
      hour late on 50 and never saw 5 — 39% of dead levels left live. So every
      level the 1h tape can build must have 1m bars to judge it. Born RED at
      7b17b77, where RETENTION_DAYS["1m"] is 5 against "1h" 60. T7's label
      named the old 5-day window as a fact; its assertion (> 30 days of hourly
      reach) was always independent of it and is unchanged.
v1.1  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r39 — T6 WENT RED ON CORRECT CODE, AND THE REFLEX FIX
      WOULD HAVE BLINDED IT. It matched a FIXED 1400-CHARACTER SLICE taken from
      the `in_range` lambda. r39 inserted the zone-traversal rule between that
      lambda and the retirement it guards; the opening-range rule was untouched
      and fully bound, and T6 failed anyway. A canary keyed to a MAGIC DISTANCE
      fires on any insertion above its target, and the obvious repair is to
      raise 1400 until it passes — which is §20's loosened canary, and every
      future insertion buys another raise until the window is wide enough to
      catch nothing. Re-anchored on the BINDING: the `if` that actually reads
      `in_range(lvl_price)`, found wherever it sits.
      ⚠️ AND IT WAS MUTATION-TESTED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, because a re-anchored
      canary that no longer fires is worse than the false red it replaced.
      Four mutants against a CONTROL that must come back clean: dropping the
      `in_range` term, dropping the tine exemption, and renaming TRAVERSED are
      each CAUGHT; inserting forty filler lines above the guard PASSES, which
      is the false red this revision removed.
v1.0  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r36 — born red at r35 (1006003), where `load_tape`
      reads `interval='1m'` and `daily_levels`/`load_daily` exist.

WHY THE HOUR. Retention kept 1m for FIVE DAYS (until r108) and 1h for SIXTY
(`RETENTION_DAYS`), so the board reached nine days back while twelve weeks of
hourly history sat unread in the same store. Measured 2026-09-17 against the
operator's own 1D chart: three of his five levels above spot were not in the
ledger at all. Operator: *"use 1-hr as far back as you can"*, then *"use the
hour exclusively"*.

WHAT IS PINNED (v2.0):
  T2   an hourly bar's high/low IS the extreme of its hour — no PARTIAL bars
  T7   reach — the book sees more than 30 days back on the hourly tape
  T8   1m retention >= 1h retention, so a breach can be judged on 1m for
       every level the hourly tape builds (r108)
