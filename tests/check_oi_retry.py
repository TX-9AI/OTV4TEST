"""tests/check_oi_retry.py — v1.0
THE OI WARNING FIRES ONLY WHEN THE RETRY ALSO FAILS (OI.1).

v1.0  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r66 — `OI: fetch failed for 100 symbol(s)` fires on
      13 of 13 cycles and is a FALSE ALARM. v4.2's guard keys only the LOGGING
      to the string "loop is closed"; the `for attempt in (1, 2)` loop retries
      either way, so the batch recovers on attempt 2 and the very next line
      reads `fetched 534 symbol(s), 534 cached`.
      ⚠️ THIS CHECK EXISTS BECAUSE I READ THAT WARNING AS 100 LOST CONTRACTS
      AND WAS WRONG. O1 is the assertion that caught it: it PASSES at base,
      which is what proves the retry already worked. A born-red set that had
      included O1 would have been the defect I was claiming, and it is not
      there — the base column is the evidence, not the build column.

🔑 IT DRIVES THE REAL FUNCTION. A fake `tastytrade.market_data` is injected into
`sys.modules` so the production import inside `fetch_open_interest` resolves to
it; the fake raises the REAL error text once per batch, then succeeds. Grepping
for the guard would prove only that somebody wrote a condition (§21).

⚠️ THE FIXTURE RAISES THE VERBATIM MESSAGE FROM THE JOURNAL, not a paraphrase.
A guard keyed to a string is defeated by a fixture that invents its own string —
that would be the same defect one level up (§0.4).

  O1  a batch that fails ONCE with the real error still returns its OI
  O2  ...and the failure is not logged as a failure (the retry succeeded)
  O3  a batch that fails TWICE returns nothing for those symbols
  O4  ...and THAT is logged, naming the retry
  O5  the old string-keyed guard would NOT have rescued O1 (the defect, pinned)
  O6  plan_tick / plan_check hold 90 days — the wargaming corpus

Born red at 5876d49 on O2, O4 and O6. ⚠️ O1, O3 and O5 PASS at base and that
is the point: the retry was never broken, only mis-narrated.
