v1.1  2026-09-24  OTV4TEST r131b — THE LINE IS OUTSIDE; THE BREAK BAR ONLY ARMS;
      THE STOP MUST SIT IN THE RANGE. Operator, same day: "No, never. If this
      happens, we wait for a valid retest." / "the candle that started inside
      the range and closed at the very top of the range, but did not go past.
      It is the break, if the very next candle opens on the range and moves
      away that's not a retest." / "The stop should be inside the opening
      range to be a valid set up, and the sizing is based on the depth of
      that candles, extreme." R4 RE-POINTED (v1.0 pinned at-the-line = inside;
      the property "no tolerance at the boundary" moves to the new
      convention). Added R4e/R4f, S1-S4, V1-V4, L1-L2.
v1.0  2026-09-24  OTV4TEST r131 — A RUNAWAY ENDS THIS BREAK, NOT THE SESSION;
      "OPENS INSIDE" IS THE PREVIOUS CLOSE; NO TOLERANCE AT THE BOUNDARY.

THE OPERATOR'S RULINGS, 2026-09-24:
  (1) "A close back into the range is a new opportunity full stop."
  (2) "It obviously opened inside because the previous candle closed inside."
      (09-24 09:58 printed its open at 736.06, 4c above the 736.02 range
      high, while 09:57 closed 735.97 inside.)
  (3) "keep it pegged to what the tape actually does" — no cents buffer.
PLAN_SPEC §29.1: the runaway means "ORB is finished on THIS break"; §29.6:
"No limit on qualifying setups per session". Before r131 the engine made a
runaway terminal for the session and orb_plan refused every tick after it.

Every case DRIVES the real `analysis.orb_engine.ORBEngine` through `update()`
— the live loop's entry point, latches and 50% acceptance included — one tick
per 1m bar with the forming bar in the frame (the harness of
check_orb_restart._live), on synthetic bars built TO THE SPEC above. R5 drives
the real `strategy.orb_plan.ORBPlan.prepare()` on that engine.

Range 700.00-702.00, width 2.00, long 50% = 703.00, short 50% = 699.00.
Boundary convention (r131b): at-or-beyond the line = OUTSIDE, strictly between
= INSIDE. A close exactly ON a boundary is a break and never "back inside". A
break candle's range-side extreme ON the line counts as within the range.

  R1  after a runaway, a 1m CLOSE back inside re-arms to WAITING_FOR_BREAK;
      closes that stay outside keep it dormant; past the cutoff it EXPIRES;
      a restart's tape replay re-arms the same way (R1r)
  R2  the next fresh impulsive candle arms a NEW attempt with ITS OWN stop
      (its low for a long, its high for a short), fresh 50% latches
  R3  a bar whose own open is OUTSIDE but whose previous close was INSIDE is
      an impulsive candle (both sides); it is not its own retest; a bar whose
      previous close AND own open are outside is still not a break
  R4  no tolerance: a close ON the line does not re-arm a runaway, 1c inside
      does; a close ON the line is the break; after a break it is not inside
  S   (2) the break bar is never its own retest; (c) a bar opening ON the line
      is not a retest (body strictly outside); the 09-22 09:34/09:35 shape;
      a restart replay does not read 09:30-09:33 bars
  V   (b) stop = the candle's range-side extreme; ON the line is valid; wholly
      outside the range is refused by name and the engine keeps waiting
  L   last_close_inside and AWAITING_RANGE_REENTRY: the line is outside
  R5  orb_plan no longer refuses with the RUNAWAY reason after the re-arm
  R6  unchanged: a runaway still hands off; a retest still fires; a
      close-inside still re-arms; a restart replays to the same state
