"""tests/check_orb_window.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r20 — W5 RE-DERIVED and W6 WIDENED to "no level
      surface reaches this file at all"; W7/W7b ADDED (the contract comes from
      the plan, no strike re-derived, and the conviction bump is gone).
      🔑 THE ASSERTIONS RUN ON TOKENISED CODE, comments and strings removed.
      §20 says scope a canary to a definition rather than a mention, but this
      file's changelog and its struck doctrine block are REQUIRED to name
      `select_orb_strike` and `conviction += 0.15` in order to describe removing
      them — so even a shaped pattern matched the documentation, and W7/W7b went
      red on their own prose on the first run. Mainline r365 hit this identically.
      Tokenising ends the class: the changelog can now say anything.
      Born red at 98eea8d on W6, W7 and W7b.
THE ORB ENTRY WINDOW IS 11:30, IT AGREES WITH THE DEBIT BLOCK, AND EVERY COPY
OF IT AGREES WITH config.

v1.0  2026-08-30  r193 — the window moved 11:00 -> 11:30 and the pool stopped
      moving the target. Born red at r192 (81a6233): the constant reads (11,0)
      there, two test files hardcode their own (11,0), and orb_strategy pulls
      the target to a named pool.

🔴 W3 EXISTS BECAUSE THE CONSTANT HAD THREE COPIES AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS THE
ONE THAT TRADES. `tests/cascade_harness.py` and `tests/cascade_real.py` each
declared their own `ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET = (11, 0)`. A harness rehearsing an
11:00 window against a fleet running 11:30 stays GREEN while measuring a
different system — the same fourth-copy shape as the PANEL mirror. This check
makes a fourth copy impossible to add quietly.

🔑 W2 IS THE ONE THAT WOULD COST A SESSION IF IT DRIFTED. Both cutoffs are
`>=` tests: the ORB window at orb_engine ~441 and the long-debit block in
`_afternoon_debit_blocked`. Equal values mean entries run to 11:29:59 and the
block takes over at 11:30:00 — no gap, no overlap. If they ever diverge, either
ORB stops arming while trades that depend on its state keep firing (the exact
contradiction the 08-20 extension was written to fix), or an ORB entry is
permitted into a window where the debit block refuses it and the refusal
arrives from somewhere confusing.
