tests/check_plan_heartbeat.py  v1.2
v1.2  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r91 — H4/H5 FREEZE THE CLOCK. They drive the real
      panel, and `show_decisions` returns early before 09:30 ET, so from r86
      (sweep moved to the 08:00 BOOT) they failed EVERY morning for a reason
      unrelated to the panel. §40.1: the wall clock was supplying the answer.
v1.1  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r84 — H6/H7/H8. Born red 3 of 9 at
      674c8d5, H6 naming all 13 ungated call sites.
v1.0  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r83 — born RED at 0e4c8f1.

🔴 THE PLANS PANEL WAS MEASURING PUNCTUATION. It asked "is this plan stale?"
by comparing the newest `plan_tick` row against a 300-second cut. r41 made
those rows EDGE-TRIGGERED by the operator's own ruling, so a plan behaving
perfectly writes nothing and turns "stale" five minutes later. MEASURED
2026-09-21 14:44: **16 of 18 rows flagged ⚠️ STALE and all 16 were correct**;
the only two that read "fresh" were the two whose reason text embeds live
prices, so every tick produced a new string.

Operator: *"I wanna see on that page if my strategies are actively evaluating
the feed. If they're not then say that, and if they are tell me what they're
looking at."* And: *"I don't think stale needs to be the same thing as window
closed. Report stale if it really is stale and report window closed if that's
the reason."*

  H1  UPSERT, NOT APPEND — the table cannot grow (r41's ruling is untouched)
  H2  a plan that RAN reads EVALUATING
  H3  CLASS: the gate is CARRIED from BOTH mechanisms, never parsed from prose
  H4  a window-closed plan reads WINDOW CLOSED and NOT stale
  H5  a plan in the admission table that never heartbeat is surfaced

# H4/H5 drive the REAL panel and read what the operator would read.
# 🔴 r91 — THE CLOCK IS FROZEN, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FIX. `show_decisions`
# returns early before 09:30 ET — "nothing yet — the session opens at 09:30 ET"
# — so both of these asserted against an EMPTY panel and went red for a reason
# that had nothing to do with the panel. They passed at r83/r84 only because
# every run until then happened during or after the session. r86 moved the full
# sweep to the 08:00 BOOT, which is before the open BY CONSTRUCTION, so from
# that revision on these two would have failed every single morning, forever.
# ⚠️ §40.1 EXACTLY — "a probe run in a shell that exported the thing under
# test destroyed the RUNTIME." Here the WALL CLOCK supplied the answer, and a
# check whose verdict depends on when it ran is a check about nothing.
# ⚠️ THE HEARTBEATS MOVE WITH THE CLOCK, AND THEY MUST. The panel's staleness
# test is `now - ts_epoch > STALE_S`, so freezing the clock WITHOUT restamping
# the rows would read every plan ⚠️ STALE and fail H4 from the other side —
# swapping one clock artefact for its mirror image. ONE instant, used by the
# writer and the reader alike.
