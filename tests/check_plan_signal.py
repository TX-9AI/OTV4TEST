"""check_plan_signal.py — v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-08  OTV4TEST r2 — PS3 reads `strategy/orb_plan.py`, where the ORB
      narration now lives ("Waiting on: impulsive candle" / "Waiting on: retest").

🔴 THE PER-TICK LOG MUST CARRY SIGNAL, NOT A TRANSCRIPT OF THE CLOCK.

Operator, 2026-08-27, reading UNH's morning: *"How much value is there in
having the afternoon strategies dominating the per-tick log during the entire
window that they're not gonna be traded? ... What's notably missing is the ORB
sequence — it doesn't appear anywhere in here. We had several qualifying
break/retests."*

TWO FAILURES IN ONE TABLE:

1. **~900 of ~1,300 rows were three credit strategies saying "it isn't 11:31
   yet", once a minute, for two hours.** A per-minute record of a clock. It
   buried the one sequence he was looking for.

2. **The ORB plan wrote a STATE LABEL and no geometry.** UNH logged 70 ticks
   `ARMED_SHORT` and one `TAKE` — with no record of where the break was, how
   deep the retest went, which attempt it was, or what the engine was waiting
   for. When a qualifying break+retest is on the chart and the bot does not
   take it, the table could not say why. Every field needed was already on
   `ORBData` and was simply never read.
