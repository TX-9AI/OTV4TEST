tests/check_plan_status.py  v1.2
EVERY PLAN IS WORKING OR INACTIVE, AND INACTIVE SAYS SO ONCE.

v1.2  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r49 — `guard()` takes a CALLABLE detail. Its `detail`
      argument was evaluated BEFORE the predicate ran, so any detail computed
      from state the predicate sets printed STALE — a failing check reporting
      the opposite of its own finding. Rendered after the predicate now.
v1.1  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r42 — S9-S12 for the operator's asymmetry: window is
      announced ONCE PER INACTIVE EPISODE, every other gate declares itself.
      S10 is `window -> cap -> window` and demands TWO rows — the sequence a
      last-value slot gets wrong by re-announcing window, which is why the
      implementation needs a per-episode SET. S12 phrases the window refusal
      three ways and demands one row, pinning that the rule keys on the GATE
      and never on the prose.
      ⚠️ AND `fresh()` NOW CLEARS EVERY MODULE DICT. It cleared `_STATUS` only,
      so `_SEEN`/`_SEEN_DAY` LEAKED BETWEEN CASES and S10 read an earlier
      case's episode — the same sequence passed standalone and failed in the
      suite, which is the more dangerous direction of that fault.
v1.0  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r41 — born red at r40 (a3ff8b9), where `close_tick`
      wrote a NOT ASKED row for every idle plan on EVERY tick.

THE OPERATOR'S RULING, 2026-09-18, verbatim:
  *"Because we know a plan is inactive outside its window, I don't need 10k rows
  explaining why. I just need 1, so I'm aware it at least 'Knows' — each plan
  should have a current status as either 'working' or 'inactive' and if it's
  working, I want per tick logging. If inactive it should just say that, once,
  until it becomes active."*

⚠️ THE ASSERTION IS A ROW COUNT ACROSS TICKS, NOT A STRING IN ONE ROW. The
defect is repetition, so a checker that reads a single tick cannot see it: the
row it finds is correct every time. S3 runs FIVE ticks in one state and demands
exactly ONE row — which is the only shape that fails on the old code.
