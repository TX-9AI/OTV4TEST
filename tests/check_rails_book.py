tests/check_rails_book.py  v1.2
v1.2  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r126 — R8/R9 MOVED HERE from check_plan_prepares T1/T2
      (§38.4), which tested the same property on the old mapper's
      `publish_tines` — deleted with the mapper. A SLOPED rail is judged where it
      STOOD at the closed bar's own minute (`tines_now(..., minutes_back=1)`):
      R8 a bar that reached the rail as it stood then is a touch though it is
      below the rail's value now; R9 a bar that reaches the rail's value NOW but
      not where it stood then is not. Both pass on r125 too — a moved property,
      not a new behaviour.
v1.1  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r115 — THE FORK'S DEATH MOVED TO ITS BUILDER, SO ITS CHECKS
      MOVED WITH IT (moved, not removed — §38.4). R3/R4/R5/R7 asserted that the
      LEVEL engine invalidates a fork; the operator ruled "it's gone when the
      engine says it's gone, not when a strategy says it's gone". They are now
      check_fork_invalidation F1 (breach), F3 (restart), F4 (new identity), F6
      (identity by price) and F7 (the level engine does NOT withdraw). This file
      keeps what the level engine still owns: the TOUCHES (R1, R2, R6).
THE FORK'S RAILS ON THE OPERATOR'S DEFINITIONS — driven through derive().

v1.0  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r114. Born RED at the r113 engine, whose rails still
      ran the old tine branch (0.15% close tolerance, depth-graded WICKED/REJECTED,
      no notion of a fork being invalidated).

The operator, 2026-09-23: "Any interaction that doesn't cause the fork object to
destruct is a touch. A breech is an event that invalidates the fork."

  R1 a wick that REACHES a rail exactly and closes back inside is a touch ->
     REJECTED on the rail's id (the old path needed the wick strictly beyond)
  R2 a wick past the rail that closes back inside is a touch, pierce recorded
  R3 a 1m close beyond the rail by 0.05% (inside the OLD 0.15% tolerance) and the
     next open beyond -> the fork is INVALIDATED: an INVALIDATED row, no rails from
     tines_now, and the board reads fork "absent"
  R4 §22: a restarted engine on the same store does not resurrect that fork
  R5 a fork with a NEW identity (new anchors) serves rails again
  R8 a sloped rail is judged where it stood on the bar's minute (moved from
     check_plan_prepares T1 at r126); R9 its mirror (T2)
  R6 no WICKED rows are written for rails (the old branch does not run)
  R7 identity survives the rolling frame: the same fork one bar later (every
     anchor idx - 1, prices unchanged) is still invalidated — r19 keyed on idx
