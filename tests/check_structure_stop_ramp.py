tests/check_structure_stop_ramp.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r91 — born RED at a26da0c, R0 NAMING the
      missing machinery rather than dying on a traceback. Pins the
      operator's 1-R ramp end to end: the structural stop, the two
      declared ends of the scale, the wide-stop and total-loss holes,
      ORB/Breakout parity, the entry-armed structure-floored trail, and
      the blast radius (every other strategy keeps r44's gain floor).

r91 — THE OPERATOR'S 1-R RAMP, AND THE BLIND SPOT THAT HID ITS ABSENCE.

His specification, 2026-09-22: *"position sizing was supposed to be based on
the stop distance represented by the entry point measured down to the extreme
of the impulsive candle. That distance is our 1-R. If the impulsive candle is
deep in the range, it'll create a large stop distance and risk to the operator
is very high, so we allocate a smaller position size when the extreme of the
impulsive candle is close to the boundary it creates a very small risk to the
operator so we scale up accordingly."*

And the two ends of the ramp: *"that 1050 is a minimum. The orbs entire budget
is the maximum and it's used for scaling."*

🔴 WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN MORE ROWS IN `check_orb_budget`. That file
already claims to prove the curve — B3, *"tight stops get the budget, wide
stops get a 1-lot, monotone in between"*. Its helper is:

    def orb(prem, w, d, budget):
        return rm.size_for("long_debit", premium=prem, orb_width=w,
                           orb_stop_distance=d, budget_usd=budget)

**IT PASSES NO `stop_premium`.** So every check in that file takes the
`_sp > 0` FALSE branch, where `by_risk` falls back to `by_geometry` — the
branch production NEVER takes, because production always supplies a stop. B3
proved the operator's curve on a code path no trade has ever used, stayed
green for four days while the live path was flat, and could not have gone red.
§40.1: a check that is well-formed, passes, and is about nothing.

⚠️ SO EVERY CHECK BELOW SUPPLIES A REAL STOP PREMIUM, and the ones that matter
drive `OptionsSignal.stop_premium()` rather than hand-rolling a number — a
fixture built from the assistant's own belief cannot fail (§0.4).

# 🔴 THE RAMP'S TWO ENDS ARE DECLARED HERE, BEFORE config IS IMPORTED, AND
# THAT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE — IT IS §36.
# A checker runs from `boot_sweep` and from `land.sh` with NO service
# environment, so it reads config's bare defaults ($200) rather than the
# operator's declared numbers. The first run of this file went RED on seven
# checks for exactly that reason: at a $200 ceiling every row clamps to a
# 2-lot and the ramp collapses — a verification going red on ENVIRONMENT
# rather than CONTENT, which is precisely what teaches an operator to skim
# reds (`check_gates` paid for this lesson with pytest).
# ⚠️ THE ASSERTIONS BELOW READ `config.ORB_RISK_USD` / `config.ORB_BUDGET_USD`
# RATHER THAN THESE LITERALS, so the fixture can be re-declared without
# rewriting a single check. What is pinned is the SHAPE of the ramp between
# whatever two ends are set — never the operator's particular dollars, which
