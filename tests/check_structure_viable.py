v1.2  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r24: V8-V12 drive `is_spent` on REAL closed rows in a temp
      trades.db — the `_SPENT` dict and `mark_spent` are deleted. V9 re-derived to
      the fork's r5 ruling (spent on ACCEPTANCE only: a breach exit spends, V9b a
      stop-out does not); this file's pre-fork V9 pinned r154's stop-out rule.
v1.1  2026-08-27  r160: V6 re-pinned — no R hurdle in the sweep; survivability before READY. — v1.0

🔴 A STRUCTURE THAT CANNOT SURVIVE ITS OWN BID-ASK IS NOT A BAD TRADE.

Operator, 2026-08-27, after CVX entered the SAME 198/192 spread seven times in
seven minutes — each stopped inside a minute, about -$170 total:
*"It's allowed to enter bad trades, but if structurally it can't even survive
for a minute we need to address the structure."*

THE MEASUREMENT, straight off the alerts: credit $0.58, stop $0.67 (15%).
**The stop was NINE CENTS away** on a contract quoted in nickels. One quote
update moves the mark further than the entire stop distance — the trade was
stopped out by its own SPREAD, not by price.

⚠️ THIS IS NOT THE R HURDLE AND MUST NEVER BE MUTED BY RELAXED. R asks whether
a trade PAYS ENOUGH; relaxed exists to collect the population R would refuse.
This asks whether the trade can EXIST — construction, like requiring a
protective wing before selling undefined risk. A trade closed before it opened
teaches the sample nothing except how fast the loop spins.

⚠️ UNIVERSAL BY CONSTRUCTION. It compares two numbers from the same chain, so a
$9 stock and a $7,000 index are judged identically. That matters because
`WING_WIDTH = 5.0` is a FIXED DOLLAR amount — one strike increment on SPX, SIX
on CVX — which is how a 6-wide spread collecting $0.58 looked normal to the
code.
