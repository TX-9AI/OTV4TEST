tests/check_sweep_liveness.py  v1.2
v1.2  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r5 — L2–L5 read the plan's PLAN_CHECKS; CONDITIONS is gone.
v1.1  2026-09-04  r241 — RE-DERIVED. Every check pinned a CEILING —
      that MAX_AGE_BARS existed, resolved to 48, was FOUNDATIONAL and admitted
      33-48 bar sweeps. r241 removes the gate outright per the operator's
      ruling, so asserting a ceiling would pin the thing being removed. What
      survives is SWP.5's actual point: liveness is `invalidated`, the age is
      still RECORDED, and an unmeasurable sweep refuses on its own terms.
v1.0  2026-09-03  r230 — SWP.5 WAS RULED AND NEVER WIRED. `sweep_credit_spread` read
`SWEEP_CS_MAX_AGE_BARS`, a name defined nowhere, so the ceiling was the
getattr DEFAULT of 6 while SWP.5's measured 48 sat unread in config.

⚠️ ANCHORED ON DEFINITIONS AND VALUES, NEVER ON MENTIONS (WORKING_AGREEMENT
§20). The changelog above names `SWEEP_CS_MAX_AGE_BARS` and `relaxed.widen`
while explaining their removal — a canary matching either STRING would trip
on the very prose §5 requires. L2 parses the AST; L3 reads the resolved
value. Neither can match a comment.

⚠️ AND IT EXECUTES (§21). L4/L5 drive the real gate function, not the source
text: asserting the file CONTAINS `MAX_AGE_BARS` proves nothing about what
the gate does with it.

Plain script, exit code, no pytest (§36 — the boxes' venv has none).
