tests/check_sweep_liveness.py  v1.4
v1.4  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r105 - L3 INVERTS. It used to pin
      `sig.sweep_age_bars = 0` as deliberate while the inherited mainline gate
      check_age_gate_gone A3 demanded the real measurement - two gates in one
      tree requiring contradictory things, invisible because A3 died on an
      AttributeError for seventeen days. L3 is AST-based, because the comment
      explaining the removal names the field (SS20). L3b pins the journal, L3c
      pins where the measurement actually lives, and L3d pins that the MAPPER's
      field of the same name is a DIFFERENT quantity and still gates.
v1.3  2026-09-22  OTV4TEST r102 - runnable under the lander's system
      python3; it could not import the venv and so had never run as a CHECK.
      Declared as one now: L3 is the gate that caught r102 starting to change
      `sig.sweep_age_bars` away from the 0 r5 chose deliberately.
v1.2  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r5 — L2–L5 read the plan's PLAN_CHECKS; CONDITIONS is gone.
v1.1  2026-09-04  r241 — RE-DERIVED. Every check pinned a CEILING —
      that MAX_AGE_BARS existed, resolved to 48, was FOUNDATIONAL and admitted
      33-48 bar sweeps. r241 removes the gate outright per the operator's
      ruling, so asserting a ceiling would pin the thing being removed. What
      survives is SWP.5's actual point: liveness is `invalidated`, the age is
      still RECORDED, and an unmeasurable sweep refuses on its own terms.
v1.0  2026-09-03  r230 — SWP.5 WAS RULED AND NEVER WIRED. `sweep_credit_spread` read
`SWEEP_CS_MAX_AGE_BARS`, a name defined nowhere, so the ceiling was the
getattr DEFAULT of 6 while SWP.5's measured 48 sat unread in config.

⚠️ ANCHORED ON DEFINITIONS AND VALUES, NEVER ON MENTIONS (WORKING_AGREEMENT
§20). The changelog above names `SWEEP_CS_MAX_AGE_BARS` and `relaxed.widen`
while explaining their removal — a canary matching either STRING would trip
on the very prose §5 requires. L2 parses the AST; L3 reads the resolved
value. Neither can match a comment.

⚠️ AND IT EXECUTES (§21). L4/L5 drive the real gate function, not the source
text: asserting the file CONTAINS `MAX_AGE_BARS` proves nothing about what
the gate does with it.

Plain script, exit code, no pytest (§36 — the boxes' venv has none).
