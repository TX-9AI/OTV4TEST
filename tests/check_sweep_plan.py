v1.3  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r120 — E6-E8: THE EXIT'S BREACH IS THE OPERATOR'S BREACHED
      (a 1m close beyond, then the next 1m open beyond), through the same
      level_rules the book uses. E1/E2 hold under both rules and so could not
      tell them apart; E6 (the forming bar opens beyond after ONE close — exit),
      E7 (two closes beyond, each next bar opening back INSIDE — hold) and E8
      (a breach since entry is not forgotten when price comes back) are red
      on r119's two-close count for exactly that reason.
v1.2  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r113 — the r106 venv bootstrap (refused under the lander's system python3 on pandas).
v1.1  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r24 — X1 DRIVES THE RULE, NOT THE HOOK'S SOURCE. The spent lock is
      read from trades.db now; X1 writes a breach exit and a stop-out as REAL
      rows and asserts only the breach spends (the r5 rule this check was born
      to hold).
v1.0  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r5 — THE SWEEP VERTICAL'S EXITS, ON HYPOTHETICALS
      (PLAN_SPEC §31.4), through the REAL `ExitEngine._evaluate_condor_leg`.
      The entry side (levels from the store, the REJECTED trigger, the anchor
      on the level, freshness, depth, spent) is pinned in check_plan_prepares
      S1–S9 and T4–T7.

  E1   two closed 1m bars beyond the pool -> sweep_breach_accepted (the level is spent)
  E2   one close beyond, then back -> HOLD (a wick is a test, one close is not acceptance)
  E3   the 15%-of-risk stop fires BEFORE the breach read when the premium says so first
       (operator: "2 minutes into a dead thesis could rack up some serious losses")
  E4   the nickel close at 0.05
  E5   a TCS vertical is untouched by the sweep's breach rule (setup_type routes it)
  E6   🔴 r120: one close beyond, the FORMING bar opens beyond -> BREACHED, exit now
  E7   🔴 r120: two closes beyond, each next bar opens back inside -> NOT breached, hold
  E8   🔴 r120: breached since entry, price back inside now -> still exits (a breach is final)
  X1   trade_logger marks the level SPENT only on the breach exit, not on a stop-out

Born red at r4: E1 (no breach exit), X1 (spent on any stop-out).
