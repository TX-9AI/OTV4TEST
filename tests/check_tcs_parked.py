tests/check_tcs_parked.py  v1.2
v1.2  2026-09-09  OTV4TEST r9 — the window lives on the plan (tcs_plan.py may read it);
      P5b's reader set updated; main.py reads it from the plan (HYG.5).
v1.1  2026-09-04  r238 — RE-DERIVED. It asserted (0,0); the window is now
      the operator's spec and the park is held only by `OT_TCS_ACTIVE=0` on the
      boxes. Asserts the SPEC, both window ends, and that management reads no
      entry-window constant.
v1.0  2026-09-04  r237 — TCS IS PARKED AT ITS FIRST GATE. Operator, 2026-09-04:
      *"Set the impossible variable and comment it in the changelog. We're
      doing a rewrite tomorrow anyways."*

⚠️ EXECUTED, NOT READ (§21). P1 drives the real `prepare()` and asserts the
verdict and the named reason, because a config constant proves nothing about
what the strategy does with it.

⚠️ AND IT PINS THE BLAST RADIUS. The reason this constant was chosen over a
quality bar is that it is TCS-ONLY: `TCS_START_ET` is pinned equal to
`CREDIT_ENTRY_START_ET` by `check_entry_windows`, and `R_FLOOR_STOP` is shared
with the sweep. P3/P4 pin that neither moved, so a future "just disable it"
cannot reach for the shared ones.
