v1.3  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r79 — V19/V19b/V19c/V19d: PAR DELTA IS AN EXIT.
      Born red 2 of 31 at cd8d775 on V19 and V19c. V19b and V19d are the
      CONTROLS and are green on BOTH sides by design — a rung that exited
      everything would pass V19 alone and silently delete the strategy.
v1.2  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r75 — V18/V18b: the exit bar must POSTDATE the
      entry. Found LIVE, not in review.
v1.1  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r74 — V17/V17b/V17c: it must be able to fire from
      the OPEN. Fixtures rebuilt on the 1-minute frame.
v1.0  2026-09-21  OTV4TEST r72 (CTRL.1) — born RED at 7e8a19c, where the VOLT
      modules do not exist and V0's guard refuses to continue. 25 checks.

r72 — VOLT, THE CONTROL ARM. Born RED at 7e8a19c (r71), where the modules do
not exist and V0 refuses to continue.

🔑 WHAT THIS GATE IS REALLY PROTECTING. VOLT's entire value is that it gates on
TWO things. A third gate does not make it a better strategy — it destroys the
measurement the strategy exists to produce. V9 pins the gate COUNT for exactly
that reason: the failure mode here is not a bug, it is a well-meaning addition.

Drives the REAL plan, the REAL admission table and the REAL exit engine against
fixtures (WA §21 — a test that reads source text proves nothing about runtime).

  V0  the modules import and VOLT is registered
  V1  window 09:35-11:30, half-open at BOTH edges, driven through decide()
  V2  it blocks nothing and is blocked by nothing — the control property
  V3  outside the window the plan is DORMANT and prepares nothing
  V4  the volume gate REFUSES below the prior and PASSES at/above it
  V5  direction is close vs the SESSION OPEN, driven BOTH ways
  V6  the stop is the structural extreme of the last N 5m bars
  V7  the trail arms at exactly ARM_R x R and its floor is NEVER below entry
  V8  the exit engine routes VOLT to its OWN evaluator, not the ORB's
  V9  SCOPE: exactly two gates refuse an otherwise-valid setup

# ── V19 — PAR DELTA IS AN EXIT (r79, EXT.1) ───────────────────────────────
# 🔴 THE OPERATOR'S RULING, LIVE, 2026-09-21: *"When Delta reaches PAR, we
# need to get the fuck out."* At par delta the position is stock carrying an
# expiry — no convexity left — so a run-fraction trail costs FULL DOLLARS
# exactly when the trade has already won. Measured on 81b1afae: $4,630 held,
# $2,880 of leash, $45 of theta risk.
# ⚠️ EVERY CASE DRIVES THE REAL `evaluate()`, never the source text (§21), and
# every fixture is deliberately HEALTHY on every other rung — the structure
# stop is far below, the premium floor far under, the trail un-breached — so a
# PASS can only come from rung 2b and not from something else firing.
