tests/check_zones.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-23  OTV4TEST r124 — RETARGETED, NOT REMOVED (§38.4), with the code it
      pins: the board's `zones`/`walk` moved from derived/level_map into
      derived/levels (`_zones`/`_walk`, verbatim) and its width now comes from the
      book (level_book.zone_width over hourly BARS, set on the engine as
      `_zone_width`). Every assertion is unchanged; Z1 measures the book's width
      function on the same bars, Z2-Z4 the moved `_zones`, Z5 the board with the
      engine holding the book's width instead of a tape. And the r106 venv
      bootstrap it never had: under system python3 it died on pandas.
CLUSTERED EXTREMES ARE ONE ZONE, AND ONLY ITS OUTER MEMBERS DECLARE ANYTHING.

v1.0  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r39 — born red at r38 (5c7213b): no `zone_width`, no
      `zones`, and `board()` walks individual levels.

THE OPERATOR'S SPEC, 2026-09-18, verbatim:
  *"When session extremes, by recency first, cluster in close proximity I want
  the extremes of the outermost (highest, lowest) of the cluster to count as a
  touch when the nearest part of the zone is tested, and breached when the
  furthest part of the cluster is accepted beyond"*; *"it's just grouping and
  only the outer members of the group declare anything"*; *"when we have a
  breach of the cluster everything that was a part of the cluster needs to go
  with it"*; *"one zone containing spot isn't a zone, then. It's done — as a
  zone is defined, it's finished. There's no reclaim trade for that."*

⚠️ THE WIDTH IS COMPUTED, NOT STORED — the instrument's own median hourly wick,
recomputed continuously. Measured across three symbols the wick/range ratio
holds at 31-37% while percent-of-spot spans FOUR-FOLD, so a stored percentage
would have been wrong on MU by 4x. That is why Z1 asserts a MEASUREMENT.
