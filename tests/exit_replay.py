tests/exit_replay.py  v1.3
v1.3  2026-09-07  r299 - relaxed rows kept (operator ruling: it is all paper, and paper vs live is the split that matters).
v1.2  2026-09-07  r297 - --all-history added: `_r_tool` is shared and now passes it. The default
window also moves from TODAY to DAY ONE ONWARD via warehouse_source.
v1.1  2026-08-23  S3 DEFAULT SOURCE: trades from raw/trades, quote paths from
the raw/quote_series batches (push_series, r86) — loaded once per run and
indexed per streamer symbol, so control replays without touching a box.
--db/--feed remain the explicit local escape hatch. SOURCE lines always
printed; the positive control and the named-refusal machinery are unchanged.
v1.0  2026-08-23
REPLAY EVERY CLOSED TRADE'S REAL PREMIUM PATH — rebuilt from `quote_series` —
under alternative exit ladders. The manifold's first paying consumer.

v1.0  2026-08-23  Built for the R-factor project. stop_sweep.py works on two
extremes per trade; this works on the WHOLE PATH, so trail parameters (arm
level, giveback width) become measurable instead of argued. This is exactly
the data FEED_MANIFOLD.md said was being destroyed when chain_marks was
last-write-wins — kept per tick since r61, consumed here for the first time.

HOW A PATH IS BUILT
  · Legs come from the row's own symbol columns (short/long/lower/center/
    upper). Sign: shorts −, longs +, orientation flipped for
    is_short_position so a RISING path is always FAVOURABLE. Single-leg
    debit rows carry no leg columns and fall back to `symbol`-prefix
    matching in quote_series only when it resolves to EXACTLY ONE contract;
    ambiguity is refused, never guessed.
  · Each leg's mid = (bid+ask)/2, forward-filled onto the union clock.
    Marks outside (0, 1e6) are dropped at ingest — finite is not sane.
  · ⚠️ COVERAGE IS A GATE. Expected points = trade lifetime / 15s. Below
    50% the trade is refused BY NAME with its drop reason (r39: a tool-caused
    absence must not wear the costume of a null). Refusals are summarised;
    a report with silent drops is the defect class this repo keeps finding.

RULES REPLAYED (premium-fraction space, per side convention as live):
  stop only · stop+TP · trail(arm A, give G): once favourable ≥ A, exit when
  path falls G below its running peak. The RECORDED exit is replayed too and
  must reconcile with pnl_usd within tolerance — a path that cannot
  reproduce what actually happened is not trusted to score hypotheticals
  (positive control, DRF.1's lesson).
