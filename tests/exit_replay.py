tests/exit_replay.py  v1.5
v1.5  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r63 — THREE REPAIRS TO r62'S OWN REPAIR. (1) The stop
      regex had no word boundary, so `tcs_stop_15%_of_credit` and
      `trail_stop_10%` both read as premium stops (measured). (2) The reconcile
      band multiplied the tolerance BY the derived stop, so r62 made the check
      LOOSER on wider stops — 56% of entry cost at a butterfly's 40% — which is
      backwards; it is keyed on entry cost alone now, and 0.35 is recorded as
      an UNFITTED prior rather than a measurement. (3) A control that applied to
      ZERO rows passed silently; it now shouts and marks the hypotheticals
      UNVERIFIED, and the applied count is reported on every run.
v1.4  2026-09-19  OTV4TEST r62 — THE TOOL REPLAYED NOTHING AND BLAMED THE TAPE.
      Five defects in one file, four of them masking each other. (1) sys.path
      carried tests/ and not the repo root, so any repo import silently failed —
      harmless until this revision needed one. (2) `legs_of` never read
      `option_symbol`, refusing 25 of 44 banked rows as "no leg symbols".
      (3) it queried `streamer_symbol=?` with an OCC string, matching 0 of 24
      traded contracts where 19 have quotes under the transform. (4) the
      butterfly CENTRE leg was weighted -1 against a position of -2. (5) the
      closing verdict blamed the tape and named a masked service as the remedy.
      Plus: orientation derived via `is_credit_vertical` instead of the
      writer-less `is_short_position`, and a selftest built from real formats
      on both sides instead of one invented string it handed to itself.
v1.3  2026-09-07  r299 - relaxed rows kept (operator ruling: it is all paper, and paper vs live is the split that matters).
v1.2  2026-09-07  r297 - --all-history added: `_r_tool` is shared and now passes it. The default
window also moves from TODAY to DAY ONE ONWARD via warehouse_source.
v1.1  2026-08-23  S3 DEFAULT SOURCE: trades from raw/trades, quote paths from
the raw/quote_series batches (push_series, r86) — loaded once per run and
indexed per streamer symbol, so control replays without touching a box.
--db/--feed remain the explicit local escape hatch. SOURCE lines always
printed; the positive control and the named-refusal machinery are unchanged.
v1.0  2026-08-23
REPLAY EVERY CLOSED TRADE'S REAL PREMIUM PATH — rebuilt from `quote_series` —
under alternative exit ladders. The manifold's first paying consumer.

v1.0  2026-08-23  Built for the R-factor project. stop_sweep.py works on two
extremes per trade; this works on the WHOLE PATH, so trail parameters (arm
level, giveback width) become measurable instead of argued. This is exactly
the data FEED_MANIFOLD.md said was being destroyed when chain_marks was
last-write-wins — kept per tick since r61, consumed here for the first time.

HOW A PATH IS BUILT
  · Legs come from the row's own symbol columns (short/long/lower/center/
    upper). Sign: shorts −, longs +, orientation flipped for
    is_short_position so a RISING path is always FAVOURABLE. Single-leg
    debit rows carry no leg columns and fall back to `symbol`-prefix
    matching in quote_series only when it resolves to EXACTLY ONE contract;
    ambiguity is refused, never guessed.
  · Each leg's mid = (bid+ask)/2, forward-filled onto the union clock.
    Marks outside (0, 1e6) are dropped at ingest — finite is not sane.
  · ⚠️ COVERAGE IS A GATE. Expected points = trade lifetime / 15s. Below
    50% the trade is refused BY NAME with its drop reason (r39: a tool-caused
    absence must not wear the costume of a null). Refusals are summarised;
    a report with silent drops is the defect class this repo keeps finding.

RULES REPLAYED (premium-fraction space, per side convention as live):
  stop only · stop+TP · trail(arm A, give G): once favourable ≥ A, exit when
  path falls G below its running peak. The RECORDED exit is replayed too and
  must reconcile with pnl_usd within tolerance — a path that cannot
  reproduce what actually happened is not trusted to score hypotheticals
  (positive control, DRF.1's lesson).

# 🔴 r62 — THE POSITIVE CONTROL WAS MODELLING THE WRONG EXIT RULE.
# It replayed EVERY trade under a hardcoded 25% premium stop and compared the
# result to `pnl_usd`. Most of this book did not exit on a premium stop at all:
# measured, the vocabulary is `hard_stop_NN%` / `stop_NN%` / `premium_stop_NN%`
# (real premium stops), against `orb_trail_stop`, `hard_close_15:45_ET`,
# `sweep_breach_accepted`, `runaway_thesis_dead`, `runaway_fizzle`, `handoff`
# and `orb_structure_stop` (which are not).
# ⚠️ IT SURFACED AS A FALSE ALARM ON A WINNER: a GEXPinButterfly that held to
# `hard_close_15:45_ET` for +$1,630 was replayed under a 25% stop, exited at
# -$130, and the control reported the TOOL as suspect. A butterfly has no
# target and holds to 15:45 behind a 40% floor — the control was asserting a
# rule the trade never ran under. §20: a canary that fires on correct code is
# the one that gets loosened and then misses the real thing.
# ⚠️ AND THE OBVIOUS REGEX IS A TRAP — `(\d+)%` matches the `pnl=-26.5%` tail
# and yields a 1%, 4% or 9% "stop". The percentage is only meaningful when it
# is bound to a STOP TOKEN.
# 🔑 NOT APPLICABLE IS NOT A PASS. A row whose recorded exit was never a
# premium stop is counted and named separately, never folded into either bucket.
# 🔴 r63 — THE WORD BOUNDARY IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART. r62 shipped this
# unanchored and SEARCHED, so the match walked straight through any prefix:
# measured, `tcs_stop_15%_of_credit` -> 0.15 and `trail_stop_10%` -> 0.10, both
# read as premium stops they are not. We emit neither string today, but
# `orb_trail_stop` already exists and a percentage on it is one line away.
# ⚠️ THE LOOKAHEAD IS A BACKSTOP, NOT THE FIX, and the distinction is measured
# rather than assumed: the mainline control agent deleted `(?!_of_)` from its
# own copy expecting red and got GREEN, because with `\b` the character before
# `stop` in `tcs_stop` is `_`, a word character, so the boundary alone rejects
# it. The lookahead only bites on a BARE `stop_15%_of_credit`. Kept, because it
# is free and the next emitter may not carry a prefix — but it is not what
# closes the hole here, and a reader should not think it is.
