tests/gen_write_map.py  v4.2
Generates docs/WRITE_MAP.md — what every box writes, and who writes it.

v4.2  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r18 — A TABLE NAMED THROUGH A CONSTANT WAS INVISIBLE,
      AND FOUR MORE WERE "(unattributed)" ONLY BECAUSE NOBODY ADDED THE LINE.
      `derived/base.py` writes `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {STATUS_TABLE}`, so
      `derived_engine_status` — written by every derived engine every tick, read
      by `tools/manifold_health.py` — appeared NOWHERE, while the flag list
      reported "No writer (0): none" and the header reported 29 tables. The map
      that exists to make a table with no writer visible was itself blind to a
      writer with no literal. Module constants are now resolved into their own
      placeholders; the substitution is conservative and an unresolvable name
      simply stays invisible, which is the old behaviour rather than a wrong one.
      Plus `gate_disposition`/`plan_check`/`plan_tick` -> derived_store.db and
      `resting_orders` -> resting_orders.db, all four verified against the live
      files on the box — the last of which is a FOURTH database the map had
      never named.
v4.1  2026-08-26  r146 — THE MAP WAS ORDER-DEPENDENT AND FAILED THE GATE ON
      CONTROL WHILE PASSING IN THE SANDBOX. `scan()` recorded a READ only if
      the table's creator/writer had ALREADY been scanned, and `_files()`
      walked directories in FILESYSTEM order (os.walk, unsorted). So a reader
      that sat in a directory walked before its writer's directory was
      silently dropped — and which directory walks first differs between two
      machines. It surfaced the moment r146 moved plan_tick's creator from
      derived/ to strategy/. Fixed: directories are walked sorted, and reads
      are collected in a SECOND pass after every writer is known. The output
      is now a function of the tree alone.

v4.0  2026-08-25  Operator's ask: "a document that answers what does every box
write and who writes it — like a file map, but for journal writers."

WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM FILE_MAP.md. That map answers "what calls what" from
the import graph. This answers a different question the import graph cannot:
**which module OWNS which table.** By r70 this repo had 22 tables across three
databases and NO SINGLE INDEX of who writes them — the ownership lived only in
scattered docstrings, which is the same shape as the sensor problem: a thing
that exists with no way to see it whole.

⚠️ GENERATED, NEVER HAND-MAINTAINED. A hand-kept write map drifts exactly the
way the version headers drifted across day_trader_pro — the changelogs advanced
while the title lines went stale for weeks. This is regenerated in the gate.

⚠️ IT REPORTS WHAT THE SOURCE SAYS, NOT WHAT A SCHEMA DUMP SAYS. A live
database shows tables that exist; this shows tables the CODE creates and
writes. The difference is the interesting part — a table in the db with no
writer in the tree is an orphan, and a writer whose table nobody reads is dead
weight. Both are visible here and in neither place alone.

Run:  python3 tests/gen_write_map.py           # regenerate
      python3 tests/gen_write_map.py --check   # fail if stale

# nothing: `derived_engine_status` — written by every derived engine on every
# tick and read by `tools/manifold_health.py` — was absent from a document
# whose flag list reported "No writer (0): none".
# 🔑 THE FAILURE RENDERED AS A SMALLER, PLAUSIBLE COUNT rather than an error,
# which is this repo's most-repeated defect shape (WORKING_AGREEMENT §35).
# So module-level `NAME = "table_name"` constants are resolved and substituted
# into their own `{NAME}` placeholders before anything is matched.
# ⚠️ DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE: only a bare uppercase assignment to a single
# lowercase identifier, only inside a `{...}` placeholder, only in the file
# that declares it. An unresolvable name substitutes nothing and the table goes
# back to being invisible — which is the old behaviour, never a wrong answer.
