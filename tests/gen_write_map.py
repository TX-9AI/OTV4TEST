tests/gen_write_map.py  v4.4
Generates docs/WRITE_MAP.md — what every box writes, and who writes it.

v4.4  2026-09-20  OTV4TEST r67 (MAP.5) — THE SAME BLINDNESS AS v4.3, ONE
      PUNCTUATION MARK OVER, AND THIS TIME IN THE READ COLUMN. v4.3 taught
      this file to resolve `f"DELETE FROM {table}"` inside a loop over the
      module's own constants, because the purge deletes that way. It never
      learned the OTHER placeholder spelling: `warehouse/s3_push.py` reads
      TWENTY tables as `"SELECT * FROM %s" % table`, and every one was
      invisible. The map credited it with the two tables it names literally
      and its flag list reported SEVEN tables as having NO READER while
      s3_push was pushing all seven to the warehouse.
      🔑 THREE SHAPES WERE NEEDED AND ALL THREE ARE LOCAL EVIDENCE, never
      cross-module inference: (1) `_sql_template` matches the `%`-format
      substitution as well as the f-string; (2) `_iter_members` is an explicit
      recursion instead of a whitelist walk, so a CONDITIONAL iterable
      (`SERIES_TABLES if tables is None else tables`) contributes the branches
      that resolve; (3) `_param_consts` resolves a loop over a PARAMETER from
      this module's own call sites, which is how `tables=DERIVED_SERIES_TABLES`
      reaches the one generic pusher that serves two stores.
      ⚠️ CONSERVATISM IS UNCHANGED — an unresolvable branch, name or call
      contributes NOTHING rather than a guess, and attribution is still gated
      on tables some module CREATEs.
      ⚠️ MEASURED FALSE-POSITIVE SURFACE, because "it should be safe" is not
      a measurement: exactly THREE modules in the tree own module-level string
      collections naming real tables — `s3_push` (20), `retention_purge` (23)
      and `manifold_health` (1) — and the regenerated map's ONLY diff is
      s3_push entering the read column. The purge does not appear as a reader
      of what it counts before deleting, because `render()` already excludes a
      table's own writers from "read by".
      ⚠️ ONE RESIDUE, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE REDISCOVERED:
      `push_table(..., "circuit_breaker_events", ...)` passes the table as a
      STRING LITERAL ARGUMENT to a parameterised pusher — a fourth shape this
      does not resolve. That table already has `query.py` as a reader, so no
      flag is affected; `check_map_accuracy` R1b pins the gap so it is a known
      exclusion rather than a silent one.

v4.3  2026-09-14  OTV4TEST r28 (MAP.3) — THE PURGE'S DELETES WERE INVISIBLE,
      ON THE ONE PATH THAT HAD JUST DELETED LIVE ROWS. `warehouse/retention_purge.py`
      deletes through `f"DELETE FROM {table} ..."` inside loops over its own
      policy dicts (`ARTIFACT_DAYS`, `DERIVED_ARTIFACT_DAYS`, `DERIVED_CDC_DAYS`),
      so the map credited it with `candles` only while it deletes from thirteen
      more tables. `--check` was green: the map was current and wrong (MAP.2).
      r18's constant resolution could not help — the placeholder is a LOOP
      VARIABLE, not a constant. `_loop_sql()` now reads the AST: a `for` whose
      target (or first unpacked name) is the placeholder, over an iterable built
      ONLY from this module's own literal dict/list/tuple/set constants of
      strings (plus `list`/`sorted`/`tuple`/`set` and `.items()`/`.keys()`), has
      each f-string SQL in its body matched once per member. ⚠️ CONSERVATIVE AS
      r18's: any other name in the iterable skips the loop, so an imported
      constant or a runtime value stays invisible (the old behaviour), and only
      tables some module CREATEs are attributed. `tests/check_map_accuracy.py`
      W1b pins that no NEVER_PURGE table picks up a delete.

v4.2  2026-09-13  OTV4TEST r18 — A TABLE NAMED THROUGH A CONSTANT WAS INVISIBLE,
      AND FOUR MORE WERE "(unattributed)" ONLY BECAUSE NOBODY ADDED THE LINE.
      `derived/base.py` writes `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {STATUS_TABLE}`, so
      `derived_engine_status` — written by every derived engine every tick, read
      by `tools/manifold_health.py` — appeared NOWHERE, while the flag list
      reported "No writer (0): none" and the header reported 29 tables. The map
      that exists to make a table with no writer visible was itself blind to a
      writer with no literal. Module constants are now resolved into their own
      placeholders; the substitution is conservative and an unresolvable name
      simply stays invisible, which is the old behaviour rather than a wrong one.
      Plus `gate_disposition`/`plan_check`/`plan_tick` -> derived_store.db and
      `resting_orders` -> resting_orders.db, all four verified against the live
      files on the box — the last of which is a FOURTH database the map had
      never named.
v4.1  2026-08-26  r146 — THE MAP WAS ORDER-DEPENDENT AND FAILED THE GATE ON
      CONTROL WHILE PASSING IN THE SANDBOX. `scan()` recorded a READ only if
      the table's creator/writer had ALREADY been scanned, and `_files()`
      walked directories in FILESYSTEM order (os.walk, unsorted). So a reader
      that sat in a directory walked before its writer's directory was
      silently dropped — and which directory walks first differs between two
      machines. It surfaced the moment r146 moved plan_tick's creator from
      derived/ to strategy/. Fixed: directories are walked sorted, and reads
      are collected in a SECOND pass after every writer is known. The output
      is now a function of the tree alone.

v4.0  2026-08-25  Operator's ask: "a document that answers what does every box
write and who writes it — like a file map, but for journal writers."

WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM FILE_MAP.md. That map answers "what calls what" from
the import graph. This answers a different question the import graph cannot:
**which module OWNS which table.** By r70 this repo had 22 tables across three
databases and NO SINGLE INDEX of who writes them — the ownership lived only in
scattered docstrings, which is the same shape as the sensor problem: a thing
that exists with no way to see it whole.

⚠️ GENERATED, NEVER HAND-MAINTAINED. A hand-kept write map drifts exactly the
way the version headers drifted across day_trader_pro — the changelogs advanced
while the title lines went stale for weeks. This is regenerated in the gate.

⚠️ IT REPORTS WHAT THE SOURCE SAYS, NOT WHAT A SCHEMA DUMP SAYS. A live
database shows tables that exist; this shows tables the CODE creates and
writes. The difference is the interesting part — a table in the db with no
writer in the tree is an orphan, and a writer whose table nobody reads is dead
weight. Both are visible here and in neither place alone.

      python3 tests/gen_write_map.py --check   # fail if stale
