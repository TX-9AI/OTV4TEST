"""tools/boot_sweep.py — v1.2

v1.2 (2026-09-25) — OTV4TEST r144. THE SIGNAL JOURNAL IS SCRATCH TOO.
      2026-09-25: the boot sweep's ORB checkers wrote 126 retest_check fixture events into the LIVE
      data/signal_journal/<date>/QQQ.jsonl on this box every morning, and on SOFI and AAL the pusher
      filed them under sym=QQQ in the warehouse - ~76 per box per BOOT, about 320 fabricated
      events in QQQ's real partition (byte-identical 71,944-byte files on two boxes). r13 and r109
      isolated the three stores; the journal was the fourth writer and nobody had redirected it.
      run_one now sets OT_SIGNAL_JOURNAL_DIR under the run's mkdtemp; check_boot_sweep
      B3/B3b require it.

v1.1 (2026-09-23) — OTV4TEST r109. THE RESTING-ORDER STORE IS SCRATCH TOO. Every
      sweep wrote a `check_entry_gate` fixture offer (symbol X, strike 81) into
      the LIVE `data/resting_orders.db` — 91 of its 101 rows by 2026-09-23 —
      because only OT_TRADES_DB and OT_DERIVED_DB were redirected. `run_one`
      now sets OT_RESTING_DB as well; check_boot_sweep B3b drives it.
v1.0 (2026-09-21) — OTV4TEST r74 / SWEEP.1. THE FULL CHECK SET RUNS AT BOOT,
SO A DELIVERY DOES NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

🔴 THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, MEASURED. Landing a ONE-LINE change was costing
**297 checker invocations** — 7 the lander genuinely forces, and 290 a full
sweep of 145 checkers across two trees, about 11 minutes. The operator,
2026-09-21: *"that is entirely ludicrous… The 30-minute per commit cycle is
choking our commit rate for needed changes."* His fix, and it is better than
the one proposed to him: *"You have an AWS auto boot daily at 0800. Why not run
the full set then & do the abbreviated when we're actively trying to land."*

🔑 THE SIGNAL IS THE DIFF, NOT THE COUNT. This tree carries 11 STANDING REDS.
A run that reports "134 of 145" tells nobody anything — what matters is that a
TWELFTH appeared. So the previous run is kept and every result is reported as
NEW / FIXED / unchanged against it. A sweep with no baseline is a number, and
§18's whole subject is numbers that look like answers.

⚠️ IT NEVER ABORTS EARLY. The operator's ruling on what to do with a failure:
*"Flag it, finish the sweep, brief it with the proposed fix and rationale why
the fix works."* Stopping at the first red would hide every red behind it, and
the brief he wants is impossible without the whole picture.

⚠️ THE BRIEF IS NOT WRITTEN HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. This script DETECTS
and RECORDS. The boot agent — raised by `tools/claude_boot.py` at the same boot
— DIAGNOSES and briefs, because a proposed fix with a rationale is not
something a sweep runner can produce. Same division as r67's shutdown cause and
r68's agent status: the thing that KNOWS writes a stamp, the thing that can
SPEAK reads it.

⚠️ NOTHING HERE IS LOAD-BEARING FOR TRADING (§29). It runs AFTER the bot and
the feed are up, never before: a sweep that delayed the 08:00 start would make
itself load-bearing, and 5.5 minutes is not 45 seconds (r68 bounded its raiser
at that for the same reason). It is niced to 19, it exits 0 on every path, and
it SKIPS ITSELF if memory is tight rather than competing with the live bot.
MEASURED on this box before it was written: with the sweep, the bot and the
feed all running, available memory floored at **298 MB of 908 MB** and swap
rose 176 -> 482 MB. Safe, but not by so much that the guard is decoration.

⚠️ AND IT NEVER TOUCHES THE LIVE STORES. Every checker runs with
OT_TRADES_DB / OT_DERIVED_DB pointed at a fresh scratch pair — r13's finding
(a fixture landed as a live open position) and the operator's own standing
rule that a check once purged live data.
