"""tools/claude_boot.py — v1.6
RAISE AN AGENT SESSION AT BOOT, AND PROVE IT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING.

v1.6 (2026-10-03) — OTV4TEST r231 (BOOT.7). OT_BRIEF: A BOX CAN HAVE ITS OWN BRIEF. The operator
      brought up SPX-TEST on this repo and its first session believed it was QQQ-TEST, because
      docs/HANDOFF.md is written for QQQ and every box read it. OT_BRIEF names a brief under docs/
      (e.g. docs/HANDOFF_SPX.md); unset, missing, or outside docs/ falls back to HANDOFF.md and says
      so in the log. FIRST_BOOT.md still wins while the installer's marker exists. QQQ-TEST sets
      nothing and is unchanged.

v1.5 (2026-09-29) — OTV4TEST r170 (BOOT.6). THE 08:00 SESSION DIED ON ITS FIRST
      TURN TWO MORNINGS RUNNING, AND THE BOOT ALERT SAID "UP" BOTH TIMES. The
      operator restarted it by hand on 09-28 and 09-29: *"now that it's two in a
      row, would you mind looking into what happened?"*, then *"Yes, it's worth a
      shot"*. MEASURED from the two transcripts: the brief landed at 08:00:28
      and the first reply, 3-4 s later, was a synthetic API error — *"Could not
      refresh your login because another Claude Code process is refreshing it
      (or exited mid-refresh)"* — and Remote Control dropped. The login file was
      rewritten at 08:10:40 and Remote Control came back by itself at 08:10:43,
      but nothing re-sent the brief. Meanwhile the alert read "Claude up
      (handoff)", because "up" meant a live claude PROCESS, and a process that
      failed its only turn is still a process.
      RULED OUT: the Claude Code version (09-28 failed on 2.1.283, which had
      booted cleanly on 09-26 and 09-27); the unit order (identical to the
      second on good and bad days); the boot sweep (its checker uses a fake
      claude); SOFI/AAL (powered off until the 09:15 wake, per 1-REPORTER's
      power ledger); control (a separate login). ⚠️ THE CAUSE IS NOT PROVEN.
      The one other claude process on this box at 08:00 is this file's own
      `claude auth status` (r132), at 08:00:17-20, and nothing refreshed the
      login successfully until 08:10:40. No lock file or debug log survives
      to confirm it, and the weekend boots ran the same check without failing.
      🔑 TWO CHANGES. (1) `auth_ok()` READS THE LOGIN FILE and starts no claude
      process: absent or no OAuth block is False, unreadable is None, exactly
      the old contract. This removes the only suspect on the box. (2) "UP" NOW
      REQUIRES A REAL FIRST REPLY. `first_turn()` reads the new session's own
      transcript: a first assistant entry flagged `isApiErrorMessage` is
      FAILED, one with a real model is OK, none within FIRST_TURN_S is UNSEEN
      (measured: real first replies landed 1-2 s after the brief on 09-26 and
      09-27). FAILED or UNSEEN is written as such to the status, so the boot
      alert cannot say "up" over a dead turn. A DETACHED `--retry` watcher then
      re-raises the handoff once the login file is renewed, or after
      RELAUNCH_AFTER_S (the 09-29 lock cleared in about 10 min), at most
      RETRY_MAX times. It stands down the moment any session replies or a claude
      it did not start appears, so it never kills a session the operator
      raised by hand. ⚠️ IT CANNOT RUN INSIDE THE UNIT: the unit is ordered
      before the bot with TimeoutStartSec=45, and a relaunch that must wait
      out a ten-minute lock would hold up the bot's 08:00 start.
      ⚠️ THE ALERT IS NOT RE-SENT when the watcher recovers (§17: a boot that
      recovers on its own is not an emergency). The recovery is written to the
      status file and to RETRY_LOG, which `--status-only` prints.

v1.4 (2026-09-24) — OTV4TEST r132. A FRESH BOX IS BRIEFED FOR A FRESH BOX, AND
      A MISSING LOGIN IS NAMED INSTEAD OF RAISED. The operator, on the unattended
      install: *"after the first boot on a fresh instance, I want Claude to come
      up with it in a remote control session and look everything over."*
      🔑 THREE CHANGES, NOTHING ELSE MOVES. (1) `choose_brief()`: while the
      installer's first-boot marker exists (`OT_FIRST_BOOT_MARKER`, default
      ~/.optbot/first_boot) the session is briefed from docs/FIRST_BOOT.md — the
      daily HANDOFF.md would send a new box's agent to catch up on a history it
      does not have. The marker is consumed only once a briefed session is
      VERIFIED up, so a failed first raise retries on the next boot. (2)
      `auth_ok()`: `claude auth status` exits 0 logged in and 1 not (measured on
      2.1.281, must-fail control an empty CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR). A box with no
      login used to raise a session that sat at a login screen and read "up";
      it now records NOT AVAILABLE with the one command that fixes it. An auth
      check that cannot run (timeout, crash) does NOT block the raise — only a
      definite "not logged in" does. (3) `RC_NAME` reads `OT_RC_NAME`, default
      unchanged (qqq-test).

v1.3 (2026-09-23) — OTV4TEST r107. THE PURGE WAS MOVING A LIVE AGENT'S FILES
      OUT FROM UNDER IT, TEN TIMES IN TWO DAYS, AND ITS OWN CHECKER WAS THE
      TRIGGER. `check_claude_boot` B7 runs this file for real with
      `CLAUDE_TMUX` pointed at a session that does not exist, so
      `agent_alive()` — which asks about ONE tmux name — said "nobody is
      running", and `main()` purged the REAL /tmp/claude-<uid>, moving every
      session directory (the live agent's scratchpad AND Claude Code's own
      `bash-edit-diff`) into B7's throwaway HOME, which B7 never removed.
      MEASURED from the orphans left in /tmp: session f3ef910f's files moved at
      06:10 ET 2026-09-22 (the 08:00-boot sweep, two seconds after the agent
      was raised) and at 16:27, 17:26, 17:39, 17:43, 17:47, 18:24, 18:48 and
      19:25 ET — every full sweep that agent ran — and 06831d64's at 21:12 ET.
      That agent reported files vanishing; the operator stopped it at 17:52.
      🔑 TWO LAYERS NOW. (1) `live_claude_pids()` reads /proc: a `claude`
      process owned by this uid is a live agent WHATEVER tmux calls it, and
      both `main()` and `purge_scratch()` refuse the real root while one
      exists. At a genuine cold boot there is none, so the boot purge is
      unchanged. (2) `OT_CLAUDE_SCRATCH_ROOT` lets the gate aim the purge at a
      fixture root; it is held to the same path regex, so it can only ever
      name the real root or a `scratchtest` fixture.
v1.2 (2026-09-21) — OTV4TEST r86. THE BOOT SESSION IS A HANDOFF, NOT A
      CONTINUE. Operator: *"instead of having a continued agent session on
      boot, it should be a handoff agent session that reads the previous
      session thread."* ~~r68's "--continue, with fallback"~~ is SUPERSEDED and
      struck, not deleted — it is why the fallback still exists. A --continue
      resumes wherever yesterday happened to stop; a handoff starts from a
      written brief and then reads the prior session deliberately.
v1.1  2026-09-20 — OTV4TEST r70 (BOX.12). PURGES STALE tmpfs SCRATCHPADS
      before raising, and appends free-tmpfs to the status so it reaches the
      boot alert. /tmp is RAM (455 MB of 908 MB here) and scratch dirs are
      keyed by session id, so they accumulate until every Bash spawn dies
      silently — which is what happened on control.

v1.0  2026-09-20 — OTV4TEST r68 (BOX.11). The operator: *"Can we have a tmux
      session Claude --continue added to the boot sequence on this box so that
      an agent is available from the moment the box auto wakes?"*

🔴 THE CHECK IS THE HARD PART, AND THE TWO OBVIOUS ONES ARE BOTH WRONG.
Measured on the live session 2026-09-20:

    tmux list-panes -t claude -F '#{pane_pid} #{pane_current_command}'
      ->  1727 bash                                  <- says BASH
    ps --ppid 1727
      ->  1731 claude --remote-control qqq-test ...   <- claude is the CHILD

`devtools.sh` launches `"claude ...; exec bash"`, so (1) the pane's foreground
command reads `bash` WHILE CLAUDE IS RUNNING FINE — a check on it would report
"not available" over a working session, and §17 says an alarm that cries wolf
stops being read; and (2) the tmux session OUTLIVES a dead claude, because the
trailing `exec bash` keeps the pane alive — so "the session exists" reports UP
over a crashed agent, which is the laundered green §18 names.
🔑 SO AVAILABILITY IS A LIVE `claude` PROCESS IN THE SESSION'S PROCESS TREE,
verified after a settle delay, and nothing weaker.

⚠️ IT REUSES `devtools.sh`'s SHAPE RATHER THAN INVENTING ONE. Same session
name, same `--remote-control qqq-test` flag (r32: the argument is OPTIONAL, so
a bare flag on the HAND OFF site could swallow the brief as the session name),
same `; exec bash` tail so the operator can attach to a pane that survives.
Two mechanisms for one job is the failure §35 keeps recording.

⚠️ AND AN AVAILABLE SESSION IS NOT A WORKING AGENT. §38.7 — *"the assistant
does not run continuously"* — is untouched by this. A resumed thread sits at a
prompt and does nothing until the operator types. This raises a door, not a
worker.

    scratchpad of a session that had been handed off, and a deleting purge
    would have destroyed it. The transcript described the build without
    containing it. **The harness itself directs every agent to put working
    files in the scratchpad**, so treating that directory as disposable is
    wrong by construction. Bytes move to `~/claude_scratch_archive` on ext4
    (5.9 GB free, no quota) and the retention sweep is the ONLY deleting path.

    boot, it should be a handoff agent session that reads the previous session
    thread. Which I believe is already standard in the turnover."*
    ⚠️ STRUCK, NOT DELETED (r33/r43/r64) — r68's ruling is the reason the
    fallback still exists, and reading only the new one would make the second
    branch look arbitrary.
    🔑 HE IS RIGHT THAT IT IS ALREADY STANDARD: `docs/HANDOFF.md` opens by
    telling the agent to run `tools/last_session.py` — the prior thread's
    operator messages, the revisions that landed in that window and how it
    ended, in 2-7k tokens rather than a 50MB transcript. So the handoff path
    ALREADY reads the previous session; it was simply second in line.
    ⚠️ WHY THE ORDER MATTERS RATHER THAN BEING A PREFERENCE. `--continue`
    resumes a thread whose context is whatever it happened to end on —
    mid-task, mid-diagnosis, possibly compacted. A handoff STARTS from a
    written brief and then goes and reads the prior session deliberately. The
    first is an accident of where yesterday stopped; the second is a briefing.
    ⚠️ `--continue` IS KEPT AS THE FALLBACK and that is deliberate: a missing
    or unreadable brief must not leave the box with no agent at 08:00, and
    resuming yesterday's thread is strictly better than silence (§0.5).
