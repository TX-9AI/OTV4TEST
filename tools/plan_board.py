tools/plan_board.py  v1.0 — WHAT EVERY PLAN IS DOING RIGHT NOW.

v1.0  2026-09-18  OTV4TEST r42. Operator: *"can you just have each plan report
      its last known status & a time stamp? For example, Active plan in progress
      or Active plan selected or inactive outside of window."*

🔑 IT WRITES NOTHING AND IT ADDS NO ROWS. The status board IS the transition
stream, read backwards: the newest `plan_tick` row for a strategy is, by
definition, its last known status and the moment it changed. r41 made the board
edge-triggered — one row per state change — so "what is it doing now" and "since
when" are the same question answered by the same row.

⚠️ THAT IS WHY CONTINUOUS LOGGING WAS NOT RESTORED. Writing a row every tick
would cost ~12,000 rows a day (measured 2026-09-17: 11,931 of 17,585 were the
idle restatement) to report a status the newest row already carries. The
repetition adds no information; it only makes the change harder to find.

⚠️ AGE IS SHOWN AND IS NOT DECORATION. A plan whose last known status is two
days old has not been asked since — which is a real fact about the box, and one
a per-tick log buries under today's noise rather than surfacing.
