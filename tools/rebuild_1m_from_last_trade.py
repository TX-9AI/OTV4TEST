tools/rebuild_1m_from_last_trade.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-10-08  OTV4TEST r262 (SEED.3) — BAR_TOLERANCE_OC_PTS 1.00 -> 3.00, BY HIS RULING. The operator, 2026-10-08 16:40 ET:
      "Yes, to all" (QQQ-TEST's recommendation of 3.00, 10-07: the 10-06 15:50 open is off 2.49 because last_trade never
      carried the value the feed's bar opened at). High/low (1.00), the tick floor (30) and the 3 verified days are unchanged.
v1.0  2026-10-07  OTV4TEST r261 (SEED.3, authored on SPX-TEST) — THE SEED GAPS ARE REBUILT FROM THE INDEX'S OWN TICKS,
      ONLY WHERE THE STORE HAS NO BAR. The operator, 2026-10-07 19:35 ET: "Let's re-seed"; told a re-seed cannot
      work, 20:17 ET: "Yes" (to bringing this to QQQ-TEST, who asked for it built and gated: MSG-1007-12).
      WHY A RE-SEED CANNOT: seed_candles v1.1 (r237) refuses a bar pushed before it closed, and mainline's pusher
      shipped ~1 in 5 1m bars only at its first ~30 s and never again (CNDL.1 history). The 10-04 repair deleted
      those 2,722 partial SPX bars, so every seeded day 08-14..10-02 holds 312 of 390 RTH 1m bars - one per 5m
      bucket, nearly always its first minute (census 2026-10-07, /var/tmp/spx_seedgap_1007). The re-seed dry run
      10-07 would insert 0 and rejects exactly 2,722 as partial.
      WHAT IT DOES. Reads raw/last_trade for THE BOX'S instrument through tests/warehouse_source.stream_series
      (the one reader, WA §36a/§38.1; rows folded as they arrive, never accumulated) and builds each RTH minute's
      bar from its ticks: open = first price, high = max, low = min, close = last, by the tick's ts_epoch.
      Volume is 0.0 - an index has none, and the seeded/feed bars carry 0.0 too.
      It writes a minute ONLY where the store has no 1m row (INSERT OR IGNORE; a held bar is never changed),
      only on a trading day (utils.market_calendar), only 09:30-15:59 ET, only within RETENTION_DAYS['1m']
      (imported: an older row would be purged that night), only with at least MIN_TICKS_PER_MINUTE distinct ticks,
      and only if the bar passes the feed's poison rule. feed_meta is never touched (a rebuild of old bars is not
      fresh). Each rebuilt day is logged to logs/rebuild_1m.log (date, minutes inserted, the thinnest minute's
      ticks): the candles table has no provenance column, so this log is how a rebuilt bar is traced afterwards.
      BEFORE --apply IT PROVES ITSELF: every COMPLETE held day (all 390 RTH 1m bars present) inside the window is
      rebuilt from its ticks and compared bar for bar with the store; a high/low off by more than BAR_TOLERANCE_HL_PTS
      or an open/close off by more than BAR_TOLERANCE_OC_PTS,
      or a minute with fewer than MIN_TICKS_PER_MINUTE ticks on such a day, refuses the apply. A complete day the
      warehouse has no ticks for is printed as "not verifiable" and does not count; fewer than MIN_VERIFIED_DAYS
      verified days refuses the apply. The comparison is printed on every run, dry or not.
      DRY RUN BY DEFAULT (the store is opened read-only).
      FAILS LOUDLY, non-zero and named: no instrument; a disagreeing --symbol; the store missing or with no candles
      table; AWS credentials not resolving (a boolean, WA §38.7); the warehouse unreadable; zero objects listed.

THE NUMBERS, WITH THEIR BASIS (measured 2026-10-07 on SPX, warehouse raw/last_trade vs this box's held 1m bars):
  MIN_TICKS_PER_MINUTE = 30   every RTH minute of 10-05/10-06/10-07/09-23 had ticks; the thinnest held 54-58
                              (median 60, ~1/s). Half the normal rate is a thin minute, refused rather than guessed.
  BAR_TOLERANCE_HL_PTS = 1.00 high/low. 1,170 bars on 10-05..10-07: max |dH| 0.47, max |dL| 0.63 (~0.008% of
                              price); an extreme is robust to which minute a boundary tick lands in.
  BAR_TOLERANCE_OC_PTS = 3.00 open/close - RULED 2026-10-08 (r262; was 1.00). The same 1,170 bars: max |dO| 2.49, |dC| 0.79; 1,169 within
                              0.79. The 2.49 is 10-06 15:50: the feed's bar opened 7823.13, a value at the minute mark
                              that last_trade never carried (its ticks: 7823.09 at -0.7 s, 7820.64 at +1.5 s; the
                              sequence numbers show no tick missing; ev_time orders them the same). An open/close is
                              one tick, so it is off by whatever moved in ~1 s around the boundary. At 1.00 the
                              verification failed on 10-06 and --apply refused; 3.00 clears it (2.49).
  MIN_VERIFIED_DAYS    = 3    the three complete days the box has (10-05, 10-06, 10-07).
